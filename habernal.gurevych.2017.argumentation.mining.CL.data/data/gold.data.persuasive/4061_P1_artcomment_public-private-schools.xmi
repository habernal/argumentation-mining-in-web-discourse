I wanted my children to grow up with their faith being a part of their every day lives. Also, if your children attended this school, parent involvement was an expectation. As a result, every Home/School association meeting was packed. Everyone went to orientation. I knew the parents of every child my kids went to school with. Disipline was never a problem - if there was a concern with your child, you met with the teacher and/or the principle and worked out a solution. They never had any issues with bullying (they had an anti-bullying program before it was popular). My daughter chose to attend public high school. In a school of 2,500 kids, less than 10% of the parents attended orientation. The main problem with public schools is parent participation. What you see is 10% of the parents being involved and the rest of them expect the school system to take care of their kids. There is no partnership between the parents and the teachers and as a result, there is a tendancy for the parents to side (usually unfairly) with their kids. Unless you are actively involved with the ongoing education of your children, helping to shape their character and working with them to develop themselves into positive, constructive members of society, then you will wind up with what we are seeing. A school system that is struggling, against the odds to somehow, marginally educate our children. There's nothing wrong with private schools. People do not send their kids so they can associate with rich kids, they send them because they know the expectations are higher and that their kids will have a chance at a better education because of it.
