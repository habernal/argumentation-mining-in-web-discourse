My parents opted to homeschool my younger brother and I starting in kindergarten. I was reading by 18 months, and at a 9th grade reading level by the time I was 10 years old. I say this not as shameless self-promotion, but to corroborate the fact that when well executed, homeschooling can present a significant advantage to students in the early stages of their education. However, there came a point (for me that was when I was about to enter 8th grade) when we reached a mutual decision in our family for my brother and I to attend public school. It was one of the best decisions we ever made. I was able to blossom intellectually thanks to the availability of teachers and advanced classes, as well as develop socially; preparing me well for the collegiate experience. I am all for homeschooling in the early stages, however education plays a fundamental role in the quality of life an individual enjoys, therefore, children should be allowed to have a choice as to whether they are homeschooled or not. At the very least, those who are should have to comply with some form of federal oversight. To have kids well into their adolescent years unable to read, locate countries on a map, or do basic math (all situations I have personally encountered) is unacceptable. I am all for individual rights and religious freedom, but it needs to be respected in such a way that it does not allow parents to circumvent the proper education of their children.
