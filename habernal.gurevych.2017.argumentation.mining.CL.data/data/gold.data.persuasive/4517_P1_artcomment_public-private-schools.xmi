How can they learn and grow in such a place, even with high involvement and support from home? &#10;We tried it. Pulled one of our kids out of a private school into the local public school. An outgoing &amp; popular bright teenager transformed into one hiding in closets to avoid school. Pulled him out again and put him in a selective school and he's loving it. &#10;Unfortunately, for parents who cannot afford private education, live in certain suburbs or who want to send their children to a public school, the selective system is the only one that will nurture and encourage them to learn and grow amongst peers who want to learn. Parents should not be judged for trying to do what's best for their children. Agree with Moore that our children are not to be sacrificed for a utopian ideal that is just not going to happen any time soon.
