Read my lips Sally: The reason parents send their kids to private schools is that we can give our kids &quot;better&quot; friends, i.e., less of the out-of-control ferals and troublemakers that the public school system is forced to accommodate and is not given the power to properly discipline. If I send my child to a private school, at least I know he or she will be surrounded by similar kids, from middle class or lower-middle class families who put the same importance in education and discipline as I do. Yes, I am prepared to endure financial stress and forgo holidays, Sally, because I care for my children's education and future. &#10;Quite right. I would love to have sent my kids to the local state school... unfortunately it is crap so instead I choose to give them the best start and opportunities by paying and sucking up the financial stress for a few years. &#10;Tony you missed the part of the article that mentioned the multiple research showing public schools produce better or same educational results for children. The results depend mostly on the background of the family and its attitudes. The perceived advantage to private comes from their selection process, both deliberate selection and the financial one, which takes out of the public system those children who are already succeeding. Of course the private schools will do better if they enrol high ability children from richer families who can afford more advantages. There is nothing left wing about it. Here is a thought for you: send your children to a public school in a middle class area and spend the money you would pay for a private school on giving them additional opportunities... maybe tutors, maybe trips, chances to do sports, club memberships, etc. &#10;I support this Comment 1000%. This is the main reason for our choice of school for our children to shelter them from exposure to the unwashed of society that pervade the cenrral cst public schools. It may sound snobbish but that is why I travel 4 hours a day and work long hours to provide a nurturing environment for my children's education and their Social development. &#10;If Sally really means what see is writing then she will send her child to the worst school in the state so she gets to interact with all levels and itwill help that schools cohort. NOT LIKELY ! &#10;As a teacher I can verify that you have hit the nail well and truly on the head Tony. That is exactly how it is! &#10;Frankly I can't believe you have said these words out loud. You really want your child surrounded by other children from &quot;middle class to lower-middle class families&quot; ... good grief. Hate to tell you this but they don't have that option when they go to work, sit on public transport, attend a public hospital etc etc. At a guess, I imagine your child attends a private school with 'strong christian values' ... slightly ironic given your attitude to anyone not fitting into your acceptable social sphere. &#10;Unlike most people I had one child attend a very elite private school in Sydney (via a scholarship) and another attend a comprehensive state high school in the western suburbs so I speak from experience. They both received the same education and were taught by equally competent teachers. Both have equally nice friends. Yes, the private school was undoubtedly better resourced but my impression was a lot of money was spent on aesthetics e.g. gardens, cleaning windows every 5 minutes, maintaining sporting fields etc. &#10;The belief that a private school gives your child a more rounded education is a fallacy, if anything it is the opposite. Students from these elite private schools live a bubble existence. Families are expected to live their lives through the school. They only play sport against a handful of other private schools. &#10;My children's ATARs were 94 and 78 ... yes it was the one who attended the state school that got 94. &#10;Unless of course the &quot;feral&quot; parents have more money than you, in which case the private school tolerates them easily. I know too many people who were sent to private schools and had to tolerate all sorts of disruptive, anti-social, violent behaviour from other students because all the private school cared about was money. Even academic performance was a distant priority if your kid wasn't one of the stars or pets. &#10;Scrimp and save and sacrifice and work stupidly long hours to pay for private schools, chasing the mythical &quot;better education&quot; and for the vast majority, you are throwing good money after bad. &#10;Disagree - the perceived 'old boys club' is quickly surpassed once a university education is backed up with experience overseas. The grubs I had the pleasure of dealing with in a sub-par government school were the perfect training for the bullying and general psychopaths that exist at the pinnacle of a finance career. &#10;I truly feel for parents who place their children in expensive education only to be managed out during the later years due to non-performance which would adversely affect the schools statistics. I also feel for the children who feel they have been invested in and need to provide a return on investment for their parents' efforts - have seen sad examples of both.... &#10;Bang on. Correct. Well said.&#10;Debate about public versus private tends to focus upon the &quot;fantastic&quot; public education available, proponents happily deciding to sweep the lack of quality public education that exists in some areas, in particular regional areas where there may be only one public secondary school within reach. Private schools in the same areas do not tend to have the high fees and facilities a very very small number of private schools have, yet if you are making an argument, I guess examining the truth and justifying sending your children to schools with poor results and facilities could be a downfall... To those denigarating the &quot;riff raff&quot; at Government schools, with four children I am left with little financial choice about where my children go, regardless of my values, however I can assure you there are a lot of &quot;cashed up bogans&quot; at private schools these days who simply like to believe a private school is a status symbol rather than actually valuing education at all. Perhaps if you ask your children's contemporaries for their parents' resumes you could further cull your list of &quot;appropriate&quot; contemporaries. &#10;While I understand your point a little, there are just as many social issues for your child to deal with no matter what school they go to (or what uni they attend, what workplace they work in, etc). Class snobbery exists in all schools and even the wealthy breed wayward children who disregard others and will happily take them down the path of destruction with them. It is just hidden more behind the smart uniforms, manicured gardens and glossy brochures. The best grounding for your children is you, the parent. Your child's education and future is best directed from home and I don't see that the choice of school necessarily surpasses this. Your child's choice of friends is also something that should be directed from home by encouraging healthy friendships with children of similar interests, temperament, personality and discouraging unhealthy friendships with children that are bullying, controlling, nasty or ringleaders of misery - irrespective of the families backgrounds. These kids are in all schools and probably in equal proportions. &#10;So how does anyone explain the trams full of ill-mannered boys and girls going to and from Melbourne Grammar, Wesley College etc? School nor home teach them any manners and they just come across as the entitled little horrrors they are. &#10;Groan, another private school rent seeker, who feels that when they make a lifestyle choice for their children, society has to subsidise it. If you want to send you children to a private school, you are welcome to, but just don't expect that the rest of society has to subsidise your aspirations. &#10;An issue here is that parents who send their children to private schools in order to &quot;avoid ferals&quot; are part of the problem, because more and more children are removed from the public system. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. &#10;A personal perception of mine is that in sending children to private schools, many parents are &quot;outsourcing&quot; parenting, because that are too lazy/busy (use whichever term you like) to get engaged in the education of their children. In the end, they land up paying loads of money for something that isn't necessarily better than the public system. &#10;For what it is worth, I do not believe private schools should get taxpayer funding."/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="8722" language="en" documentId="4390" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Tony" date="September 04, 2013, 6:19AM" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://www.theage.com.au/comment/private-schools-and-the-art-of-ripping-off-parents-20130903-2t357.html" topic="public-private-schools" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="4390" notes="" title="Private schools and the art of ripping off parents"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="803"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="804" end="1034"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="1035" end="1898"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="1899" end="2271"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="2272" end="2466"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="2467" end="2580"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="63" sofa="1" begin="2581" end="3086"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="3087" end="3607"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="71" sofa="1" begin="3608" end="3923"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="75" sofa="1" begin="3924" end="4025"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="79" sofa="1" begin="4026" end="4445"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="83" sofa="1" begin="4446" end="4639"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="87" sofa="1" begin="4640" end="4960"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="91" sofa="1" begin="4961" end="5328"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="95" sofa="1" begin="5329" end="5357"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="99" sofa="1" begin="5358" end="6471"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="103" sofa="1" begin="6472" end="7522"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="107" sofa="1" begin="7523" end="7760"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="111" sofa="1" begin="7761" end="8058"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="115" sofa="1" begin="8059" end="8290"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="119" sofa="1" begin="8291" end="8638"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="123" sofa="1" begin="8639" end="8722"/><types:PersuasivenessAnnotationMetaData xmi:id="127" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" annotator="annotator2" isPersuasive="true" labelDetailed="P1" isGold="false" comment="good arguments &#13;&#10;1. &quot;The belief that a private school gives your child a more rounded education is a fallacy, if anything it is the opposite.&quot;&#13;&#10;2. &quot;A personal perception of mine is that in sending children to private schools, many parents are &quot;outsourcing&quot; parenting, because that are too lazy/busy&quot;&#13;&#10;and many others" annotationBatchName="batch2-690documents" conflictResolvingAnnotation="false"/><types:PersuasivenessAnnotationMetaData xmi:id="139" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" annotator="annotator3" isPersuasive="true" labelDetailed="P1" isGold="false" comment="very confusing comment...." annotationBatchName="batch2-690documents" conflictResolvingAnnotation="false"/><types:PersuasivenessAnnotationMetaData xmi:id="151" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" isPersuasive="true" isGold="true" annotationBatchName="batch2-690documents" conflictResolvingAnnotation="false"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59 63 67 71 75 79 83 87 91 95 99 103 107 111 115 119 123 127 139 151"/></xmi:XMI>
