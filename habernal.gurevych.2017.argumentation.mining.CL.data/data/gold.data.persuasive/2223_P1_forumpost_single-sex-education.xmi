I myself went to a co-ed, and am so glad I was able to – I only had a few close female friends, because I was way more comfortable hanging out with the boys – I just preferred playing sport during breaks than gossiping about what happened over the weekend. The girls in my year just had entirely different interests. &#10;In terms of results; I really think it's mostly up to the individual and how driven they are, coupled together with a good teacher, as to whether or not they do well. I think the social aspect of co-education outweighs the potential distractions; at the end of 6 years, you come out with a study score, but once you have that, I think the memories and friendships you got out of those 6 years become much more important, and I can't imagine having as good an experience had I gone to an all-girls school.
