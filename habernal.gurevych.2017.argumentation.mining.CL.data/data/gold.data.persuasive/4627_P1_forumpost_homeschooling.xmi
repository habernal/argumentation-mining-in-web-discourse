I know that I could never do it and make sure that my boys got a good enough education. Because I'm a much better &quot;learner&quot; than I am a &quot;teacher&quot; and admittingly I just don't have the patience that it requires. I can teach life skills w/ no problem. I can learn things for myself w/ little effort. But I cannot teach someone else on an educational level, especially since the techniques have changed so much from the way I learned. &#10;My boys have needed help w/ their homework at times, and I am honestly dumbfounded at the processes that are used today. Aside from the fact that I just could not ensure they would get the proper education they deserve for themselves, the only other con that I can see w/ homeschooling though is the socialization skills. I know there are other ways around it, but to me, the best way for kids to learn how to interact w/ their own peers is by having the opportunity to learn in an environment that isn't necessarily always something interest-based like sports, clubs, playgrounds, etc. but that's just me. &#10;I do however think that one of the biggest pros to homeschooling though (for those who do it properly and not take advantage of the way the system works) is that kids can learn at their own pace w/o having to slow down or speed up to suit another child in their class.
