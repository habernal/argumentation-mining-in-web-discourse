The sad truth about home schooling is that we have little more than glorified anecdotes. &#10;For a quick overview, first check out the comprehensive and detailed site maintained by Professor Robert Kunzman of Indiana University. Kunzman has written sympathically about homeschooling, but he explains why the frequent claims that the “average homeschooler” outperforms public and private school students are unjustified. &#10;Why do we lack such evidence? The reason is related to the massively de-regulated environment for homeschoolers. Because existing regulations for home schooling are either so minimal or so little enforced, many parents do not notify local educational officials when they decide to home school. At least ten states do not even require parents to register their home schools. &#10;A further concern is that an appalling amount of the research conducted on home schooling and given publicity in the media is undertaken by or sponsored by organizations whose explicit mission is to further the cause of home schooling. Of course, that research is conducted by persons whose pay comes from organizations dedicated to promoting home schooling is no reason to reject the findings out of hand.
