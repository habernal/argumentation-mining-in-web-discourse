This entire article is ridiculous. You are still allowed to pray in school as long as it doesn’t affect the education that the school system is trying to give our children. You can pray quietly whenever you want and does the bible not say in: &#10;Matthew 6:5-8 “And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.” &#10;You can pray whenever you want. Church may also be a good time for that kind of stuff.&#10;You cannot expect to hold up class time and such and force other people of other religions to listen to Christian prayers, Jewish prayers, Hindu, Muslim whatever it is not right to force people who do not share the same feelings about religion as you to sit there and listen to you pray is insensitive to the beliefs of others. You cannot be so ignorant to say that your religion no matter what it is, is the correct religion there is no proof that it is the correct one. If there was a correct religion and we knew about it then everyone would most likely be it, don’t you think. Why are there so many religions in the world. Because no one knows what the right one is. Look at it this way. How many religions have been founded or made off the words of one man. All one man has to do is get people to follow him and how does he do that. He instills fear into people. People are always afraid. Always thinking of death and what could or won’t happen next. Now if your scared enough and all of a sudden in what seems like coincidence, someone comes up to you and says hey you know what. I can save you I can save you from what’s to come. But you must donate so that I can build a better platform to get the word out that I can save people you must help me you must donate and don’t forget, don’t do this … this and this… or else you will not go anywhere remotely nice when you die. You know this sort of thing gets to me when people think that they are right about they’re religion or topics. Ignorance is truly bliss. Now in lieu of that last statement I am not saying that I am right in anyway shape or form. I believe that everyone should be allowed to believe whatever they want to believe and pray to whomever they want to pray. But what does bug me and what I do feel is unacceptable is when people try to impose they’re religious beliefs FORCFULLY on someone else. Who do you think that you talking to a non-religious person is going to get them to change or believe what you believe. Last time I checked you were supposed to let God do that kind of work. You know about 60 % of religious people that I have personally met are hypocrites they preach about this and they preach about that and then once they are done putting on there Sunday best they go home drink a fifth and beat their kids. Now I understand that there is GOOD and BAD in everything. Not all religious folks are good people. Not all prisoners are bad people. Hell not all bad people are BAD people. Maybe just a bad choice or two has led them down a path that they did not intend to be on. I highly doubt most bad people as kids are thinking to themselves, “ You know what, when I grow up I don’t want to be a fireman, I want to hurt people”. That is the kind of thing that parents are supposed to be teaching their kids not to do. Parents are the ones that are supposed to be teaching they’re kids values and morals and what is right and wrong. O’ and side note all those parents that think that “Angry Music &amp; Video Games” are the root of all evil and its what’s causing your children to become evil and lash out at society. YOU ARE IDIOTS. I apologize, but your child may be playing violent video games and what not, but when they go out and rape or shoot someone. It will not be because of the video game it will be your lack of parenting, maybe you should have hit them those last few times. And if any of you are saying “Well what about the belt?” there is a difference between getting a belt to the butt and physically assaulting your child multiple times with your fists. &#10;SOCIETY SIDE NOTE: The reason that society is bad today is not because of the lack of Fear for God. It is because of what our society has become. Our society has become so concentrated on how people FEEL. That if someone is FEELING bad and they don’t FEEL like going to work today then they don’t. In today’s society it has become acceptable to avoid all sense of responsibility. I know that more than half of you remember when you were young if you didn’t do what your father told you, you were going to get the belt, and you know what you sure never made that mistake again. Now, you even show your child a belt with the intention of hitting him/her and your own child can sue you. People today are basically in my mind, for a lack of a better word soft. I remember my Grandfather telling stories of the horrible things that he was forced to do in WWII things that no one should ever have to go through, NO ONE (at 19 mind you). Yet you walk down the street or listen to the 18-24ish yr olds today and they are complaining about having to work more than 6 hours at a decently paying job. &#10;Ok if anyone has actually read this entire thing I thank you for your time and I apologize if I have jumped around a lot. &#10;In conclusion, I personally believe that forcing prayer upon our children in the class room is wrong. If you want prayer forced send your child to a religious specific school. If it is a public school it should be a place where all cultures and all religions and all people should be able to come and feel comfortable in order to do what they are there to do which I’m sorry is not to learn about religion. It is to learn and become educated and become the successful people that we all know they can be. Forcing your religion on someone else is wrong and if your faith is not strong enough to withstand any of the statements above without you becoming frustrated or enraged, then maybe you should visit your local religious establishment and pray for open mindedness and patience. Thank you for your time. &#10;-Mick"/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="6548" language="en" documentId="1715" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Mick" date="07/12/2009 10:16 PM" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://www.forerunner.com/forerunner/X0098_Ban_on_school_prayer.html#c000707" topic="prayer-in-schools" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="1715" notes="" title="Banning Prayer in Public Schools Has Led to America's Demise"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="297"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="298" end="878"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="879" end="965"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="966" end="4520"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="4521" end="5611"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="5612" end="5734"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="63" sofa="1" begin="5735" end="6542"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="6543" end="6548"/><types:PersuasivenessAnnotationMetaData xmi:id="71" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" annotator="annotator1" isPersuasive="true" labelDetailed="P1" isGold="false" annotationBatchName="batch1-first100docs" conflictResolvingAnnotation="false"/><types:PersuasivenessAnnotationMetaData xmi:id="83" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" annotator="annotator2" isPersuasive="true" labelDetailed="P1" isGold="false" annotationBatchName="batch1-first100docs" conflictResolvingAnnotation="false"/><types:PersuasivenessAnnotationMetaData xmi:id="95" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" annotator="annotator3" isPersuasive="true" labelDetailed="P1" isGold="false" comment="didn't read the whole, but e.g. &quot;You can pray whenever you want.
