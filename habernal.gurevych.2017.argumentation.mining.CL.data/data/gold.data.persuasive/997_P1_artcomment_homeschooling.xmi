Think outside the box for heavens sake. Do you really think home educating parents are so small and narrow minded that they wouldn't address this? &#10;On a Monday my 4 daughters attend dancing and gym and do group activities with friends. On a Tuesday they attend a different gym lesson and often meet with friends. On a Wednesday we attend a home education group to do group lessons, followed by gym. On a Thursday one goes to gym again (she's good and loves it) while 2 others attend Brownies. On a Friday they go to dancing, musical theatre classes and an exercise class. On a Saturday they go to a local drama group at the town theatre. On a Sunday one goes to play Rugby. &#10;They meet, between them, in excess of 200 children a week and have close friendships with many of them - we never make it out to town, trick or treating or anything else without bumping in to kids they know. That is before you add in the children they know in town and across the country who are home educated, perhaps another 100. &#10;When my eldest briefly attended yr 6 last year to see what school was like she discovered 2 things - one that she was adored by all the staff and classmates for her friendly and outgoing, join in everything nature - and the other was that school seriously cramped her social style, never mind that she didn't learn anything useful in that time. &#10;Really - PLEASE move on from this. We are intelligent, informed, caring parents - we get round tiny difficulties by accessing the mass of opportunity in the world.
