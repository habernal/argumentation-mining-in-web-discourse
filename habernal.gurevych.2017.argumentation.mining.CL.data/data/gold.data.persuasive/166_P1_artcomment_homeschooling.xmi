That, within itself, is a major problem: these children do not receive that personal contactt with other children of their own ages. They simply do not learn to interact with their peers, and thus are constrained by that pressure, the rest of their lives. Happily, some parents realize this, and have their children participate in other groups, such as church, Scouting, 4H, etc. to get that additional group support, and friendships amongst their peers. This is an important part of education, and goes along with the actual learning skills and knowledge required of todays citizen, in order to further their education, get a job and advance through life. &#10;The parents, described in this article, are doing their children a disservice by refusisng to not only let them, but require them to have that knowledge, required in todays workplace. They have robbed them of the chance to advance in life, and that is child abuse. This state needs to immediately back off on the present rules, and fix the problem. Let us required the children to take standardized tests. Let us require the parents to insure those children learn the same subjects, as their age peers, in public or private schools. Let us stop the nonsense, and abuse.
