Five in New England, one in Missouri, many in California.  The educational quality varied considerably depending upon district.  One school was Dominican parochial, balance were all public schools, some catering to military brats, some to minority enrollees (dominant Asian, Black, mixed European refugee or Latino emigrant).  Some were rated superior, others ghetto inadequate. Did I sense a quality difference?   You better believe it.  Some transfers I made accelerated me three grades beyond where I'd been; others made me hustle for inclusion. The private Catholic school only taught in French and no one in my family ever used French. Math and science classes varied as did athletic programs. It was mostly a matter of tax base accounting for quality variations but politics also skewed the job scene. (It paid to have rich, powerful, handsome bachelor uncles.) If the area catered to a lower rental-class student,  less quality followed because staffs jockeyed for prestige areas if they possessed prestige credentials. Rough 'hoods are tough on anyone, even Utopian of Angels.   Inner-city low-income 'hoods displayed most deficient quality except for San Francisco where the system offer was stellar. Military-oriented public schools challenged, but on a personal level (I'd become accustomed to receiving gloved recognition) were cold, dispassionate, quota driven mills. In the Fifties-Seventies, all adults paid taxes and weren't given options, or deductions for private school enrollments. One could send offspring to a private school but responsibility for full tax payments was required as though you had a dependent benefitting from public education. Taxpayers supported public schools; back then, anyone between aged 5.5 to 18 was obligated to be enrolled unless graduated from high school (age 14-19).   If you've time, survey classes for a day.  Listen to instructors, observe the students.  Do that at several schools keeping grade level/courses observed constant.  You'll be amazed at your judgment if you've varied the sample fairly.    Ask your kids if they think they're getting/not getting quality standards/values too. Ask them reasons they feel their exposures are inadequate/superior. Ask them if they're progressing fast or being slowed due to others preparational handicaps or attitudinal clouding. Kids know more than you would believe.
