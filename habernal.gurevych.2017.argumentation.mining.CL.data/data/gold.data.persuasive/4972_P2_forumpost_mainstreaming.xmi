Your post made me feel really sad. I have a son who is 8 with trisomy 21 Down syndrome and he is currently in mainstream and i too have held him back a year. I am lucky in that the children in my sons class are all very good with him and he does seem to be liked even though his behaviour can be quite challanging at time. However, because i have held him back the children in his class are only 6 about to turn 7 so they are still quite young so that may or may not be why they are quite understanding and accepting of him . I have just made the decision to start my son in a special needs school from September as i really don't think my son will cope in a mainstream junior school. Having had two older children go through junior school i know how cruel children can sometimes be and i couldn't bear the thought of my son being left out and having no friends. Unfortunately the gap has widened and it is now noticeable. I feel my son would benefit from being in an enviroment where he doesn't feel different and where he can make friends and excel. Every child with special needs is different though and you have to trust your instincts about what is best for your son. I am lucky that i have had a positive experience with mainstream but i just feel for my son the time is right to move him. Maybe visit a special needs school and a few other mainstream junior school before you make a decision.
