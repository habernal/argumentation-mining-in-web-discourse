Jemmo suggests that &#10;which was not my experience of school at all. There were around 200 students in my year, and my classes were mixed with a variety of them, not just a particular form of thirty. In addition, the extra curricular/sports activities brought together students from all the different year groups, enabling us to mix and interact with both older and younger students. &#10;To respond to this particular article, I don´t think anyone is particularly trying to blame home education for this particular case. However, I don´t see anything wrong with a registration system where the quality of education is monitored periodically - the authors express concern that home eduation is totally different to school education and so they may be judged by `&quot;people who do not know what they are judging,&quot; but given the increasing popularity of home education, would it not be possible for education professionals who do understand home education to be able undertake tasks like this? (I don't know if it would be, this is a genuine question, are there enough people in the system with knowledge of home education to be able to implement such a scheme as this?)
