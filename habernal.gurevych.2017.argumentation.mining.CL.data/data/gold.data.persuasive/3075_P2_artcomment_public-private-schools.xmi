My son started in a private school, then he went to public school, then he was home schooled and lastly grades 9-12 he went back to public school. He graduated near the top of his class. Probably if publics schools would look at private schools as a role model, then public schools would probably get better. Also, I think a lot of public schools can wear uniforms, because kids are allowed to wear what they want and this distracts from studies. A middle school in my area did this for 4 years. The students were black and white with less than 1% other races. The school performance was a lot better in the class room. Kids were not sent to the office to have their parents or guardian bring them some other clothes and there was no surprise as to who was wearing what to school. Best thing about it, the stores that sold the clothing allowed for a trade back, and the store but up a bargain basement where students could buy the buy clothing. This also where there sales items went. Mississippi has a program for non performing schools. These schools get put on probation, and if they are performing to standards then they are closed and kids are giving vouchers to go to a school closer to them that are performers.
