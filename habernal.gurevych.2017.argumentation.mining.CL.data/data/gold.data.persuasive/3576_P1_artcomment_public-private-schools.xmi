Most public schools cannot handle really &quot;bright&quot; kids.  This is especially true at the elementary school level where they have to teach to the middle at best and the lower achieving kids most of the time.  Why?  They have to teach to the test, so their focus is making sure their kids will pass the standardized tests that are given.  Kids that are really bright, quick learners, etc. get bored and in a lot of cases start acting up.  I know because I was one of those kids.  Many of these kids then go on to underachieve in middle and high school because their initial experiences left them bored and as a result, often totally disinterested in school. Fortunately, my parents saw what was happening and moved me to a private school where I was challenged at or above the grade level I was in at the time.  That is the only thing that kept me from being a delinquent. Yes, parents can provide support and should, but when your child is bored at school, there is only so much you can do to help with that. Occasionally, you will get lucky and have a teacher that will challenge your kid in class, but if not, then what? All the enrichment camps and afterschool activities will not make up for the fact that your kid is bored for 6-8 hours per day in school and whips through their homework in a flash, or takes all night because they are so bored they can't stand it.  I believe that parents should send their kids to the school the best fits the needs of the child at the time.
