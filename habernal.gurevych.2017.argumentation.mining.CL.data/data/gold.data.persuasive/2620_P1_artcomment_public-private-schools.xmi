I also agree with  her that the students that are sent to privates are the exact students who would do well in pretty much any school as well as those being the parents that would truly make a difference in the public schools.  I'm not advocating that anyone make that sacrifice, But I do believe that she is correct in the difference it would make in schools.  The schools would become what the parents want them to be.  I'm writing my master's thesis on this very subject and its interesting to hear the testimonials of different parents that made different choices. And those asking why should they send their children to these schools.  Well I would just say, the more educated a society, the less crime their is, the less poverty there is, the less sociological and psychological problems for anyone living in that society.  I get that its philosophically American to go it alone and forge one's own path, but that's often not true, and even in a private school the students are benefitting from the support and environment of that school.  Real life is no different, but we often feel differently when that environment involves people that might be a little different from ourselves.
