That's the title of this article. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?! What is this, China, for crying out loud!?!?!? Give me a cotton-picking break!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Parents can send their children to whatever schools they want! Period. Pay attention to the United States Constitution!   This is a free country, at least for now... And unless you want to subject parents to anti-American, communist laws; then stick your nose where it belongs and attend to your own children! No one should have the right to send children to any school except for the actual parents of that individual child!   Private schools are absolutely fantastic! Homeschooling is even better! Charter schools are the answer for public schools! Face it! The public school system is failing our children, especially in the inner cities, because it's the government that runs it. The argument should rather be for taking our children out of government run schools.   Use the same extensive amounts of money we all throw into the public school system via our taxes and give it to private charter schools and watch them absolutely thrive! That's the answer. And it's happening all over the US. We have awesome teachers in so many parts of this country, including a ton inside our public schools.   However, take the unions out of the picture, fire all the bad teachers out there, and put a performance-based system in place for a privately run charter school system throughout the country. Then take the incredible amount of money that we all pay through our taxes, and put it into privately-run charter school systems that aren't mandated to indoctrinate our kids with all sorts of filth and error.   Our public school system is failing our children. So many of our children in America are being taught flat-out lies, revisionist history and/or watered down, historical inaccuracies. Every subject (math, science, language arts, social studies, etc.) in our public schools is being dumbed down to substandard education. We've got an idiotic student to teacher ratio. It's no wonder public school kids don't know basic facts. Here's just a few stats: 　 Only 43 percent of all U.S. high school students have any idea the Civil War was fought in the 19th century. ·More than 65% of all U.S. high school students cannot find Great Britain on a map.   Twelve percent of U.S. high school students cannot find the United States on a map.   More than 25% of all U.S. high school students thought that Christopher Columbus made his famous voyage across the Atlantic Ocean after the year 1750.   About 33% of all U.S. high school students do not know that the Bill of Rights guarantees freedom of speech, religion and due process.   Only 55% of all U.S. students can name the Vice-President.   We need children with well-trained minds. Speaking of which, there's a fantastic book on classical education titled: &quot;The Well-Trained Mind&quot;. Quite frankly, so many of our children are not only being sold short by the public school system, but it's a much larger problem because of the breakdown of the American family unit.   Ultimately, it's not any school's job to be totally and completely responsible for our children's education. It's the parents' responsibility. As parents, we need to teach our children. It comes down to instilling discipline, respect, truth, integrity, love, character, honesty, strong moral values and making sure our kids are overachievers instead of underachievers.   But to get back to the original question of this article: &quot;Is it wrong for parents to send kids to private schools?&quot; Please refer to the answers in my first paragraph.
