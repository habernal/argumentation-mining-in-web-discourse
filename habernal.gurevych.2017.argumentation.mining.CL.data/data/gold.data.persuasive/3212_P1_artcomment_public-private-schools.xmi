If people were not allowed to have cars then the public transportation system would be better.  By letting people own automobile, bicycles, motorcycles, etc. we are doing a great disservice to the public transportation system.    Another person that has the dream of a utopian society through socialist radical transformation.  Let just take all the competition away so we are never aware of how poor the education our kids are receiving.  Lets make it even more corrupt, and easier for the government to waste money, and use the media to lie to us that our children are getting great education and how efficient our tax dollars are working.    Where does this crap end.  Competition in schools (public vs. private), in business, in healthcare, keeps everyone a little more honest.  It creates efficiency, innovation, and makes progress take place naturally.  If you are the only game in town then you get to gouge, keep your crappy product or service the same because your the only one supplying it.    In Kentucky the very worst school system in the United States our children read at a 5th grade level (maybe) as graduating seniors.  The waste, corruption, fraud, and inside deals, makes the mafia look honest.  They now want to create public boarding schools so that parents do not influence the child's learning experience in a poor or damaging way.  The school board believes it is the parents keeping children from making progress.  Last year in order to show improvement in our children testing scores they decided to grade on a curve and to remove difficult content.  It was necessary to do this in order to keep from disenfranchising students with lower scores.  The belief is that poor little Johnny only got 2 out of a 100 questions correct and the psychological damage it is doing to him when compared to other students that got 80 out of a 100 correct was just cruel.  They are no longer teach cursive writing, spelling, and soon math because computers take care of the spelling and calculations needed.  So all our children need to learn is how to use a condom, get federal assistance, and some altered facts of history.    Lastly, and you will not believe me but in Jefferson County Public Schools they gave all the 5th grade children a handout say the Martin Luther King invented Christmas.  I kid you not I have a copy of the handout that was given to my child.
