Also, I know that I could have home-schooling my children, because I have a very high level of education, but I would not have the patient to do that, and I believe my sons were benefited with a very good education from a very good public high school with excellent teachers in Worcester County in Maryland; my oldest son is a biologist (Salisbury University) with three masters, my second son is a mathematician (MIT), and my third son is a mechanical engineer (College Park). I wrote this paragraph on a prior commentary because it is a fallacy that a great percentage of the home-schooling students attended top universities: I disagree that all the public schools in Maryland are bad. My three sons graduated from a very good high school in Worcester County in Maryland, and the three of them attended excellent universities. My second son, whom graduated from MIT, received a “Mathematics and Verbal Talent Search Award from The John Hopkins University in 1995; when we attended the ceremony we observed that most of the recipients of the awards were home-schooling students and had foreign last names. So, the data about the high percentage of the home-schooling students that graduate and that attended top universities such Harvard, Stanford, Yale, etc. is based on those students I saw in that award ceremony. From the students I taught that were home-schooling, only one was exceptional brilliant, he got a very high score in the SAT, and he attended the University of Maryland, College Park to study engineering. No everybody can teach and learn at home, and some parents and students cheat at home as well as they do at public schools, and the big problem is that nobody could catch them because the most important thing for many parents in this country is that their children should have as many “As” as possible on their resu "/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1987" language="en" documentId="243" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="ecat1246@gmail.com" date="7/29/2013 8:06 PM GMT+0200" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/students-home-schooling-highlights-debate-over-va-religious-exemption-law/2013/07/28/ee2dbb1a-efbc-11e2-bed3-b9b6fe264871_comment.html?commentID=washingtonpost.com/ECHO/item/1375121163-122-410" topic="homeschooling" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="243" notes="" title="Student’s home-schooling highlights debate over Va. religious exemption law"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1987"/><types:PersuasivenessAnnotationMetaData xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" annotator="annotator1" isPersuasive="true" labelDetailed="P1" isGold="false" comment="&quot;that a student mind has from several teachers and their way of thinking than from only one parent way of teaching.&quot;&#13;&#10;&quot;but I would not have the patient to do that, and I believe my sons were benefited with a very good education from a very good public high school with excellent teachers&quot;&#13;&#10;&quot;No everybody can teach and learn at home, and some parents and students cheat at home as well as they do at public schools, and the big problem is that nobody could catch them&quot;" annotationBatchName="batch2-690documents" conflictResolvingAnnotation="false"/><types:PersuasivenessAnnotationMetaData xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" annotator="annotator2" isPersuasive="true" labelDetailed="P1" isGold="false" comment="&quot;It isn’t the same the influence that a student mind has from several teachers and their way of thinking than from only one parent way of teaching&quot;.. also tells success stories of his sons who went to public schools" annotationBatchName="batch2-690documents" conflictResolvingAnnotation="false"/><types:PersuasivenessAnnotationMetaData xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" isPersuasive="true" isGold="true" annotationBatchName="batch2-690documents" conflictResolvingAnnotation="false"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 55 67"/></xmi:XMI>
