But when I went, they were free. So it was not a place for people who could afford them, but rather a place where you would learn your religion along with math, history, English, science, etc. But I lived in an integrated neighborhood in all sorts of ways (color, religion, nationality, etc.) and so many of my neighbors attended public schools. Many people from both backgrounds have succeeded. I think it had far more to do with what each of us put into school. Yes, I think I had great teachers. But my friends claimed that they did too and I believe them.   Over the years, what I noticed was the big difference is that the public schools have become far too dependent on school boards. If left to the teachers, I think things would go well. But in states like PA and NJ, school districts are very small and it is fairly easy to get elected on some hot button issue rather than an overall view of education. Be honest, many people run for school boards which pay nothing. What is in it for them. Sadly, in far too many cases, they do get some say on who gets contracts with the school. If you do not believe there are kickbacks, then I suspect that my arguments will not convince you. But to get elected, they have to please the parents who are notoriously not objective with regard to their own children. When I was in school, if our parents complained, they would have been told &quot;fine, send him somewhere else, we have a waiting list.&quot; My parents trusted the sisters and brothers who taught us to know more about educating their son than they did (just as they trusted our doctor to know more about what was good for my health). Unfortunately now that Catholic schools are charging tuition, in many cases they are falling into the same trap that the public schools faced some time ago.   Our graduate schools are the envy of the world. Why do so many people send their children here? But this is not so for our lower levels. Why is that? Could it be that our university teachers are much more free with what they can teach? They do not face the interference brought on by having to please so many board members, helicopter parents, etc. They are free to just teach. The charter schools are making a move this way. But they are also not as free.   From what I can see, most teachers are very good and want to help children. How about we give them a chance. When I hear the rhetoric by people like Christie who want to fire teachers as if that would solve the problem, I get very upset. If they have the power to fire teachers, they will not fire because of incompetence, they will fire older teachers and hire inexperienced ones merely to save money. If people faced these problems more honestly, they would be a lot easier to solve.
