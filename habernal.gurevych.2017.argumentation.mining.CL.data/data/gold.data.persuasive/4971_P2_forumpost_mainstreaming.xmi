He is also Blind and Deaf on one side. Hes currently in a very good normal mainstream school. &#10;There has been a massive decline in his performance at school and even more so in his maturity levels. I've already held him back a year in school... hes just so much younger in actions etc than all the other kids in his class. &#10;On friday he came home with a piece of paper from school. The whole class were doing an exercise where they had the childs name in the middle of the paper and their friends wrote something nice about them and why they like them as a friend. He had three on his paper.and one of them said &quot;your silly. Not a lot of people like you, but I do&quot;. Its really knocked him and has proper upset me. &#10;Ive been to see his teacher today. 1st to let the teacher know how P**sed off I am that she allowed him to see this but also to try and understand how deep the problem goes. Turns out none of the kids in the class really like him, he has one friend who doesnt take the mikey and thats it. Teacher says hes struggling with his work. Always gets picked last in PEetc... &#10;Hes a very happy boy who hasnt really picked up on any of this. I'm really worried how hard its going to be as he approaches late juniors and into seniors.... &#10;Anyone got any experience of special needs schools. Its a really tough decision to make.. as he has Mosiac downs, his features arent typical of that of a child with Downs, but the E.N are now starting to show.... For the first time since he was born, I'm lost and do not know what road to take...
