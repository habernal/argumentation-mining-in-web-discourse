I did ten and a half years of public school, and then switched out halfway through ninth grade to homeschool. I now do online school and I think it works fairly well for me. Yes, I succeeded in school and was generally an A student, but that was mostly because I'm naturally intelligent and capable. I have ADHD and really struggled with the classroom setting- I had too much energy to stay in my seat, I was making too much noise, I was disturbing the other kids, etc- and because of that I spent virtually all of elementary school on behavior contracts that to this day still fill me with an acute sense of shame. In middle school, I was severely bullied and isolated. That led to the development of various mental illnesses in ninth grade, and between that and the ADHD, I couldn't handle public school anymore and switched out. I had some great teachers, I had good grades, and I had a small handful of friends, but ultimately public school did not work for me. &#10;Yes, I face social barriers now, but honestly I'm just as awkward as I was in public school. I have trouble with self motivation sometimes, and take lots of breaks, but I always get all of my schoolwork done. I have many resources available to me, my classes meet all the standards to get a high school diploma, and I'm about to start working on university applications. &#10;Most of the homeschoolers I knew growing up were the stereotypical Christian homeschoolers with strict parents who didn't do anything secular or know anything about the real world. They have since then transitioned into public schools and (from my distant vantage point) seem to be doing fine. They're very socially capable and seem to be average teenagers. &#10;I don't think that the big school model is very effective. Children and teenagers can learn more from an education that is personalized, supportive, and based on learning and self satisfaction opposed to test scores and school funding. Unfortunately, we have millions of kids and not all families have the resources to homeschool. If I have kids, I will probably homeschool them, because I think that homeschooling fosters real interest and excitement in issues, compared to the stressful motivators of grades and standardized testing.
