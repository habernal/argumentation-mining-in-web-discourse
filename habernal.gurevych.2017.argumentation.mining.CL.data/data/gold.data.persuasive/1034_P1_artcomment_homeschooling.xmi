I met them when I took my youngest child who was 8 at the time out of school for a while due to relentless bulling and abysmal teaching. &#10;It was a big step for the whole family, but we knew that what ever we did would be better than what we were suffering at the time, my son started to grow taller, happier more confident - I didn't need to tell him to learn because he had always wanted to learn, but was stopped by a state system which makes you sit next to disruptive children who pinch and kick you under the table and write on your work, he flourished, we join the HE group and met a couple of times a week, went on wonderful outings, took advantage of group bookings to see and do things. &#10;We were visited by welfare and ofsted visited for a couple of hours and went through all the lovely work we had been doing - the report we received from both welfare and ofsted were glowing. &#10;The brightest students/adults I know were home educated they included a top scientist and a musical genius.
