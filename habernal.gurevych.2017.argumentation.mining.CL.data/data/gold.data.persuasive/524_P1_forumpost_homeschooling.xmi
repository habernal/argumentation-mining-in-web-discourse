I can vent though, we all do. No the post secondary thing isn't cheating, but as someone who was deeply involved and loved my school for 13 years yea when you're 17 and someone else deems it finally appropriate to use those dirty old public schools so they can get post secondary, it seems &quot;wrong&quot; even if it technically isn't. And yes it technically isn't. &#10;You're making so many assumptions there, and they've already been debunked. I don't know of a single homeschooled child who has never attended a class of some sort. Most of them have attended/are attending multiple classes. They're also involved in the community. How many times do we need to reiterate that we're not locking our children up in the basement? &#10;Well of course homeschool children go to a class here or there of some sort, join homeschool co-ops, community sports leagues etc. I don't think they are chained in the basement. I'm just saying it's still not the same &quot;overall&quot; learning experience and independent experience as being on your own for school, making more decisions year after year without your parents input or direct involvement, it's a growing experience in other ways that aren't so much involved in homeschooling. &#10;I know my opinion is unpopular, I expect backlash."/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1380" language="en" documentId="524" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="mamaKto2under2" date="09/05/2013" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://community.babycenter.com/post/a44369503/home_schooling_debate_this_hypothetical?cpg=15" topic="homeschooling" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="524" notes="" title="Home schooling: Debate this hypothetical"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="484"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="485" end="844"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="845" end="1329"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="1330" end="1380"/><types:PersuasivenessAnnotationMetaData xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" annotator="annotator1" isPersuasive="true" labelDetailed="P1" isGold="false" annotationBatchName="batch1-second200docs" conflictResolvingAnnotation="false"/><types:PersuasivenessAnnotationMetaData xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" annotator="annotator2" isPersuasive="true" labelDetailed="P1" isGold="false" comment="&quot; I'm just saying it's still not the same &quot;overall&quot; learning experience and independent experience as being on your own for school, making more decisions year after year without your parents input or direct involvement, it's a growing experience in other ways that aren't so much involved in homeschooling.&quot;" annotationBatchName="batch1-second200docs" conflictResolvingAnnotation="false"/><types:PersuasivenessAnnotationMetaData xmi:id="79" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" annotator="annotator3" isPersuasive="true" labelDetailed="P1" isGold="false" comment="for hs &quot;How many times do we need to reiterate that we're not locking our children up in the basement?&quot;" annotationBatchName="batch1-second200docs" conflictResolvingAnnotation="false"/><types:PersuasivenessAnnotationMetaData xmi:id="91" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" isPersuasive="true" isGold="true" annotationBatchName="batch1-second200docs" conflictResolvingAnnotation="false"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 67 79 91"/></xmi:XMI>
