what DO you do, if you hold them back that first year? i am in the somewhat, these days, enviable position of being a stay at home mom, and i am a nerdy book worm, so it's easy enough for me to fill her time at home with education, and in such a way that she doesn't think she's being taught, ha ha sneaky mom. how many of the redshirted kids have parents who can do that, as opposed to paying for extracurricular programs? the flip side is the parents who HAVE to put their kids in day care and pre-school, because they both work, and how many of them really find that their kids are SO much better off when they finally start school? i have not found one study that shows any tangible benefit to redshirting, and yes, i have looked, because it made no sense to me when i first heard of it, but i thought maybe there was some validity to the idea just the same. but, no, i don't see it. if you want your kid to just be a kid, DON'T put them in all these activities, unless they ASK to do them. there's no academic advantage to keeping your kid out of school for an extra year, if all you do is put them in some kind of kiddie college, or if you won't or can't teach them on your own. there's no social advantage at all; the best place to learn to be social with kids of all ages is a school! these few children who are really JUST not ready for prime time, maybe i can see it, IF these kids are doing something to help them in w/e area they are lacking, but to do it for sports, or just because they need that one extra year to &quot;just be a kid&quot;?
