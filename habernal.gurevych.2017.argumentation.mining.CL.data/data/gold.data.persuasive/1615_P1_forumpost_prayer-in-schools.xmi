Teaching religion to children who are not capable of critical thought, should be considered a form of child abuse. &#10;Children believe in magic because they have not been educated enough to know when they are being deceived. Santa Clause can visit everyone's house on Christmas Eve! The Easter Bunny left you chocolate in the back yard! If you catch a Leprechaun, you will get his pot of gold! The tooth fairy left you free money! &#10;Eventually, the parents come clean on their deceptions on all of these topics except god. The unfortunate side effect, is that as these children grow into adults that cannot unlearn the myths taught to them in Sunday school, and sit on the state board of education in many states. &#10;Is the Earth 14 Billion years old? or 6000? God placed fossils on the Earth just to fool the archeologists into believing in evolution . That Jesus! What a kidder! And god has to spend most of his time red-shifting light from every light source in the universe, just so that our astronomers believe that the universe is 14 Billion years old, rather than 6000. Whew! No wonder he has to rest every Sunday. &#10;So, now we have to seriously debate folks who believe in the literal version of their holy books (because the book says that everything in the book is true!). They will discount and distort easily observed facts, so that their belief system is unchallenged. &#10;Our country needs more people trained in math and science, and yet the education system has to tip-toe around organized religion, and the dogma contained in ancient holy books. &#10;The good news is, the American Religious Identification Survey (2008) indicates more Americans are reaching this conclusion, and freeing themselves from organized religion. It is my hope that the trend away from churches will accelerate. But we must stop the indoctrination process that young children are forced into.
