The author of this fawning endorsement suggests even more about Ms Wong - who is the bigger fool, the fool that leads or the fool that follows. A big reason that parents don't put their kids in public schools is that public schools are forced to strive towards mediocrity in an effort to be inclusive.  This comes because public schools are run by the Department of Education which is part of a government which demands equality of outcomes, not opportunity. Private schools were formed largely BECAUSE parents who wanted more for their kids could not effect changes in the system. Add to that the behavior problems which must be tolerated, the acquiescence of school/parental authority to empower politically protected social groups, the fact that public schools often practice indoctrination into political/social views to which many parents are opposed, and an unwillingness to recognize and honor the value of hard work and achievement...it is no wonder parents with resources opt out of public schools...despite the fact they are forced to continue to pay for them through their taxes. The answer is not for people putting their kids into private schools to be demonized or perhaps even forced back into public schools, but to provide a voucher system which will enable every parent to opt out if they want.
