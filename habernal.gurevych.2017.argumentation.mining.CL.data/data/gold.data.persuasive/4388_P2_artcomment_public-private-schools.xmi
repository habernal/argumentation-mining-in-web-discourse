I now wait for the trolls... &#10;Why do you have a problem with people spending their own money on their childrens education for what every reason. I would really be interested what your objection is. &#10;Next you will say the forklift driver should not be paying for those childrens private schools. He is not, the people that send their children to private schools are paying for his childrens education, his families health care etc etc. &#10;Look at the ATO stats. the top 20% of income earners are supplying 80% of the society services. We don't mind that but stop telling us were to send our children to school. &#10;I think we haven't been truly egalitarian in outlook for a long time, if ever. We seem to see ourselves as a nation of elites, where the only allowed &quot;better than&quot; is sporting prowess. Private school marketing is apparently aimed at the myth that underperformance is all about someone else's fault - those sucker tax-payers, perhaps - rather than individual ability and motivation. Motivation alone won't make up for innate lack of ability, and I'm not sure that concrete demonstrations of ambition as the primary goal is the best role model for any individual or society. I don't much like the moral precepts being taught by the private school sector debate . &#10;abc- my objection is very, very simple to understand. If you want an &quot;advantage&quot; over other parents by sending your kid to a private school, why should I be expected to pay for it? The state system provides a perfectly adequate educational system with frighteningly limited resources. And every time a well off private school gets taxpayer funding means that there's less funding for the schools that actually need it. &#10;Melboy&#10;more than likely you are not paying for these private students. if you are in the top 20% of income earners then yes you are. But if you are in the bottom 80%, like most of us, then in reality we are having our childrens education, healthcare etc paided for us. I think we should be a little more grateful. either that or go do the 10 years study and work 60 hours a week to get to being one of the top 20% earners. if we did that we would probably be sending our kids to private schools. &#10;abc- I don't even know where to begin.&#10;1. Complete this sentence: &quot;I am in the top 20% of income earners and I need a government handout because....&quot; &#10;2. In what world do the top 20% of income earners provide the majority of government revenue? Obviously, there's no such thing as negative gearing and creative accounting. &#10;3. So its &quot;more than likely&quot; that my taxes aren't funding elitist private schools. Please provide evidence. &#10;4. Do you understand what &quot;private school&quot; means? Hint: it doesn't mean &quot;public school that is allowed to kick kids out and still take government money&quot; &#10;melbunboy&#10;Even with neg gearing, super perks, PPL 805 of services come from the top 20% taxpayers. So not only pay for their our but also most of the other peoples. &#10;Check the ATO stats&#10;Melbunboy&#10;here is an idea why doesn't the government on every tax return put the average cost of services it provides. This way if you are below the figure you could at least be greatful. If you are above you can be happy you are helping people out. &#10;Bet most of the whingers are below the line&#10;abc- So GST isn't a factor (the idea that we all pay the same amount of tax for goods and services regardless of our income)? &#10;I'm still trying really hard to figure out what your point is. Is it that I should be grateful that rich people pay tax? How does that address any of my arguments? My fundamental point is that if you choose to send your kid to a private school, you should pay for it. Why should I pay for your car if you choose not to use public transport? &#10;abc - I want the government to help me fund my own army. That shouldn't be a problem using your rationale! &#10;The top 20% of income earners have the capacity to generate wealth thanks to the infrastructure and economic policies put in place over generations and paid for by the Commonwealth.....All of us. The cost to the individual in the high income bracket, is to pay a higher rate of tax. Notwithstanding other &quot;deductions&quot; and mistruths that help offset their tax burden. &#10;I'm a government school boy. Most of my friends were educated in Catholic Private Schools. With the exception of a couple, I find they have little to no understanding of history, science, philosophy, or the concept of evidence based debate and rebuttal. Schools are about giving children an education on world around them, so they are equipped to handle life's challanges. If you wish schools to also indoctrinate your children with a religion, as an Athiest, it is my firm opinion that you should pay for this yourself.
