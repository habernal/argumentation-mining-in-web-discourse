We've not got to apply just yet as DS wont be starting until 2011, but due to him having autism and a couple of bad experiences previously in pre-school, it's an area which concerns me greatly. &#10;Firstly, as I said we've had 2 very bad experiences in pre-schools before he started the one he is at now. Both resulted in huge regression because they both (though different from one another) blatently didn't know what they were doing and had no provisions in place. I spent a few nights reading through ofsted reports (the small bit about SENs) for all the local nurseries/playschools and googling for research... I eventually found the place DS is in now. It's brilliant and I can't praise them enough for the hard work they put in - though they don't expect it. &#10;Problem is that they are attached to a very, very small school and we are not directly in the catchment area. I'm led to believe that though the first choices do go to those who live very close by, DS will be OK in getting in there. I know I'm going to have to have these as my first choice. I want him in this school (mainstream btw) but if it doesn't work out (less understanding teacher, cannot cope in another way etc etc) I was hoping that would be enough evidence for the LEA to prove that he needed to go to the local specialised school for autism (which also happens to be closer than the mainstream I am talking about.) but have recently found out that there is a long wait for the specialised school, very long and we'd be offered a place at a different special school, which is 1.5 hrs away. I wont allow that, not for 3 hours of my son's day to be spent going back and to in a taxi! But I also am not willing to subject him to failing in a mainstream class and then having no option other than to continually watch him regress. &#10;Which then leads me to think that maybe I should apply and ask for him to go directly to special school? But, I am warned, if he still doesn't get a place, then I could end up being refused a place in the only mainstream one I want him in, which leaves me in an even bigger predicament! &#10;I just don't know what to do?!! So confused.&#10;Sorry for a big post, just needed a rant. Any advice or corrections appreciated.
