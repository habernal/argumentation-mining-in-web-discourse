My son went to parochial school because the school system we lived in was not good.  But since we were not Catholic he had to take a 4 hour test.  He got in and I paid $40 a month at that time it was a lot of money, 1970's.  Can you imagine what it was like to take that test at 5.  I paid taxes just like everyone else during this time.  When he went to high school I moved to Oklahoma so he could attend a public high school in the country I couldn't afford to send him to parochial high school cost to much but I knew he would get a better one on one in a small town and he did.  He went on to college finished in four years, which many don't do. I was a single parent and they give odds that single parent kids don't go to college well mine did and finished. He has a good job and a family now and is debating on sending his kids to private school.  I would do it again.  This is America we all have a chose where we want to send our kids, some public schools are great but if you can and want to send them to private why not.
