Let's look at the 'flavor of the day' argument, raising the minimum wage at McDonalds. I never eat at Mc. D's so I will use B.K.--(and I only eat there a few times a year-I'm in my 50's). But anyway, if a Whopper costs $3.00...and I don't remember if that's high or not...but the point is, if B.K. has to raise what they're paying the 'kids' working the broiler  from $7.50 to $15.00 bucks...the price of the Whopper will now have to be doubled to $6.00 (as well as many other menu items) to cover paying the workers twice as much. Point is , simple economics dictates certain things in a free market. With school systems, it's taxes. I pay an exorbidant amount of school tax where I live and DON'T have any kids. Yet I'm paying for everybody elses children to get their &quot;free&quot; education. Those who have kids and can afford it, will pay AGAIN to send their students to a private school to get the kind of education they believe they deserve but, probably WON'T get at a 'government school' . In fact, people with money to spare having to spend TWICE as much for education (their kids at a private school...and everyone elses at the public school) is just as big a waste of money as paying the local 19 year old fry-cook $20. bucks an hour. I would rather have him get his usual $8. dollars/hr. and only have to pay $2. bucks for  the frys. Then I can use the other $2. bucks to buy something else...or apply it to my overly high school taxes...or, apply it to the private school bill that will be coming soon. Or, better yet...how about I get a voucher for $3,000. instead of a tax bill and use that money to off-set the private school bill? I'll bet then I could even find an extra $2. bucks in my wallet to get an order of frys on the way home from my long work day !   You see it's ALL RELATED !!
