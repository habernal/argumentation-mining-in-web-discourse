I am pleased your children are so fortunate. However having actually been both in and out of state education I do not think that this is common. Certainly the fact that &quot;In 2003, an estimated 75 per cent of the adult population of working age had numeracy skills below the level of a good pass at GCSE and 56 per cent had literacy skills below this level&quot; suggests that I am not far wrong, but of course all their parents may have taken an interest and just been rubbish at it... &#10;I also think I was making it clear that I was not saying it IS the case, just that, from my experience, this is what SEEMS to be the case. Since I did actually point out only sentences before that I did think that generalisations were impossible, due to it being reliant on individuals, that it would be obvious that I did not think this is always the case. I just think, in my opinion, that when a person hands over the lions share of the educating of their children to another organisation that maybe, even if only subconsciously, they feel that this is them fulfilling their responsibility and that they may then put in less effort themselves...
