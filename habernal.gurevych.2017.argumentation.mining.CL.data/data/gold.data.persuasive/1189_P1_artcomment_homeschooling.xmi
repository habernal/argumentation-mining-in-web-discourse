My personal experience of mainstream school was damaging. &#10;My parents didn’t take me out of school to ‘protect me from the world’, good grief what a stupid thing to do! (And non of the home schooling families I know did/do that either, so what a silly thing to assume that's why families do it). They removed me from school because school/teachers were teaching me nothing other than ‘you are thick so why bother teaching you’. Their teaching methods, no matter how hard I tried to understand, just did not work for me. I tried SO hard to understand, I didn’t want to be ‘behind’ the other kids, but it was no good. No matter how hard I tried it was not good enough. My parents knew I was capable of more, that I was intelligent but somehow school weren’t willing to see it. I wasn’t me that ‘couldn’t be bothered to learn’ it was the teachers who couldn’t be bothered to teach. &#10;To assume parents who home school are ‘cruel’ could not be more wrong. To send a distressed and terrified child to school everyday is sick! For the record, my parents aren’t hippies, or God fearing Christians. Also to sate that home educating families are middle class could not be further from the truth, with four children and my father receiving a pitiful wage as a hill farmer and my mum being an unpaied housewife, they, nor I fall into the bizarre and inaccurate stereo type of a home educated family. &#10;As for social interacting, I used to go on camping trips, day trips, I would study with friends by rivers, in the woods, on the beach or just pop round to each others houses. It was such a positive and wonderful experience, my parents travelled far and wide to give me these experiences, for that I will always admire them! &#10;@ calminthestorm. I certainly know more than 3 home educated people, non of which went off the rails, yet I could compile a huge list of children that attended school who did. How many home educated children do you hear of that have ASBO’s? How many home educated children to you hear of committing suicide? &#10;Since the age of 10 I’ve had to put up with people judging something they don’t understand, telling my parents that they’re wrong for home schooling me (even though I could not have been happier), they never asked me (the one being home schooled) how I felt about it, if they did they still wouldn't have listened, they've made their mind up and they are sticking with their inexperienced views. I’m sick to death of it! It is, and always has been pure ignorance, stop slating something you have no experience or knowledge about. &#10;I am one of 4 children, my sister thrived in mainstream school, so my parents let her stay there, my two brothers went to a different school altogether, school for boys with learning difficulties and they thrived in their school. To believe ‘one size first all’ is clearly coming from people who have never suffered from learning difficulties themselves, from bullying, from the physically ‘sick with dread’ feeling one gets on the Sunday knowing that tomorrow is a school day. I’m dyslexic, at school I could barely read, but after being home schooled my GCSE’s were mainly A’s and B’s and I now have a degree, this would not have been possible at school. I would have failed without a doubt! I have a daughter now, and after an awful lot of thinking and discussing, I feel she, like my sister, is well equipped for school (emotionally, mentally and academically), I feel when she starts in September she will thrive. However, if I were to have another child, who knows, maybe if I feel he/she will benefit from being homeschooled that will most definitely be the road I go down. &#10;All our children are different so why should we teach them all in the same way/style, surly that’s just common sense?
