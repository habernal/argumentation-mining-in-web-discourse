Why would anyone write an article sighting that parents are &quot;bad&quot; for choosing private over public,let me guess, probably a progressive liberal who feels that ALL children need to be indoctrinated with garbage and forced sexuality that is not age appropriate. Yes I took my son out of public school because I felt that the (lack of) education he was receiving was not up to standard. He was in 5th grade and his spelling words were the days of the week,and one of four native English speaker in his class. The teachers from my experience, expect the students to teach themselves, they have more important thing to do like converse with their friends(other staff),take care of personal business etc. Oh and now in Ca.,add the confusion of gender identity to the mix,where 98% of the students will be forced to accommodate less than 2%, causing many to be afraid of using school restrooms because now all any student has to say is &quot;I feel like a boy/girl today so I want to use the opposite gender restroom today&quot; and now preteen/teen boy can just walk into a girls HS locker room/shower any time he wants,even while girls are showering. This article was nothing more than union propaganda because we all know how supportive unions are of non-union entities.One more thing, at least a private school can FIRE a teacher for legitimate reasons ( molesting kids, etc) unlike public schools who's teachers unions have PROTECTED those who have committed crimes against our children(ex. teacher feeding his semen to children on cookies).
