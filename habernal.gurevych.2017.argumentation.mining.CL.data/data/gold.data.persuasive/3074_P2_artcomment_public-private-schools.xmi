Every private school I've ever heard of offers scholarships for some students to attend, so just because Susie down the street goes to one, it doesn't mean that she has a privileged life that will allow her to thrive based on economics in her house.   This doesn't even begin to account for the quality of schools. WHY, as a parent, should I send my child to a terrible school if I have other options? Full disclaimer here - we have very few private schools in our area (all are religious) and our school district is actually pretty good. Even so, parents can only influence the schools to a certain degree. I have a couple of friends who have transferred their children to different elementary schools because they encountered issues that were &quot;deal breakers&quot; to them and that the schools were unwilling to work with them on.   When you accept the responsibility of having and raising a child, you accept the responsibility of doing your best for that child to help them thrive and succeed in the future. The education they receive is a large part of that, and if private schools in your area are superior, and you can manage a way for your kids to attend, then you have every right to do what you feel is in their best interest.
