If someone can afford to send their children to a private school, and feel, that it is better than, or more to their viewpoint than, the public schools in their area, they do and should have the right to their own decision. If you don't want to send children to a private school, and that is your point of view, fine! Don't. Also, many suburban, and other, school districts are highly successful, and produce a high quality graduate.   Having worked in inner city schools for most of my educational career, I would not want to send my children to those schools, if I lived in those districts, if I could avoid it. Many of the youngsters come from difficult home situations, poverty, and a lack of involvement from parents in the educational process. There are extreme behavior problems, which are, often, tolerated by the parents and the school area. Schools, under the current conditions, are forced to allow difficult, and behavior problem students to be mainstreamed. Any successful disciplinary actions are not allowed by the school administrators, politicians, and courts. So, the difficult students disrupt education for all of the students, and very little can be done to solve the situation. This includes violent outbursts, and violent attacks on other students. Principals and teachers can do almost nothing to truly deal with the situation, and so, there will be no improvement in the public education until these problems are addressed. The needs of the &quot;difficult&quot; students are the  concern of the politicians, and student rights' organizers. However, they forget the needs of the rest of the students. Private schools have the luxury of removing difficult students, and sending them back to the public schools. Also, private school parents are, agreeably, very concerned, and involved, in the education of their youngsters, and that is all to the favor of the youngsters attending them.
