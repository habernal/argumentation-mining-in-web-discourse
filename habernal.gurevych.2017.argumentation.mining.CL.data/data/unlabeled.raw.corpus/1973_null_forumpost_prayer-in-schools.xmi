Most of history is neither recorded nor observable, and the few instances that are recorded are inadequately described with any detail. &#10;A person must use the information that is presented to their best benefit. Removing as much contradiction as possible brings me to this conclusion. The stone tablets have a basis for existing and the rules quoted are consistent with rules that could survive a millenium without any required changes. &#10;I made these blatant statements to express my opinion and instigate a response. I am guilty of exactly what you say. So I will preface my statements henceforth that these are my opinions. &#10;Many books reference the Ten Commandments. Like many history books reference a particular event and then go on to express their opinions about how to interpret the event. &#10;That many books reference the Ten Commandments gives it statistical significance since the books themselves are contradictory with one another. &#10;In my opinion, I do not believe that there are exceptions.&#10;These are social issues that change depending upon society. There are families in the world that are incestually sexually active and it is locally accepted. The roman times also present such acceptance. In our current society it is unacceptable. &#10;But let's take this to an extreme. A serial killer kidnaps children and the children are raped and mutilated. You have never known your real father as you were adopted. You find out that this Serial Killer is your biological Father. Can you still do what is socially right and still be reverent to your Father? Of course you can. You may not, I wouldn't imagine I could understand the complex feelings a person would feel in this situation. But yes, they could still have respectful feelings toward their father. &#10;What rules do you think could be set down today, that would still be relavent ten thousand years from now and all time in between? Even with technological advances where cloning, accelerated physical development, extraordinarily long lifetimes, cybernetics, and a host of other technologies will significantly change our social behaviours. And make those rules so that we can understand them today, without knowing anything about what is going to be developed a thousand years from now. &#10;I suppose the rules would have to contain the seeds necessary to grow a system of beliefs that would allow people to coexist socially and prepare themselves for greater things to come. &#10;Multiple threads, not all, are strongly related to my suppositions. I'm lazy, I really don't feel like retyping the basis of my viewpoint so many times. But it has allowed me the interaction I was looking for. &#10;I learn through multiple situations. Debate is one of them."/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2962" language="en" documentId="1973" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="jamesbdunn" date="29th November 2006 11:51 AM" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://www.volconvo.com/forums/showthread.php?t=11753&amp;page=7" topic="prayer-in-schools" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="1973" notes="" title="The Bible in Public Schools"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="137"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="138" end="390"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="391" end="691"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="692" end="880"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="881" end="1052"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="1053" end="1197"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="63" sofa="1" begin="1198" end="1256"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="1257" end="1503"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="71" sofa="1" begin="1504" end="2017"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="75" sofa="1" begin="2018" end="2505"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="79" sofa="1" begin="2506" end="2691"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="83" sofa="1" begin="2692" end="2902"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="87" sofa="1" begin="2903" end="2962"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59 63 67 71 75 79 83 87"/></xmi:XMI>
