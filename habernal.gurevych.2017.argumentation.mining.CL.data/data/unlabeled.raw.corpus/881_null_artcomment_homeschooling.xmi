When I was in school, it was good for me, and when I was being homeschooled it was also good for me. &#10;That said, I have a lot of experience with homeschoolers and most of them know that giving their children an &quot;opportunity to develop their social skills in a controlled and supervised environment&quot; is part of their responsibility as teachers of their kids. It's why they participate in schooling co-ops (where parents with specialized skills teach a group of children), enroll them in some classes in school (my little brother took several classes and &quot;normal&quot; school while he was being primarily schooled at home), as well as having their children participate in school-related or extra-curricular activities (the area I lived in was very home-school friendly, so we were permitted to participate in school-sports/orchestra/drama etc for a fee). &#10;There are definitly home-schoolers who are failing their children socially or educationally, but no form of schooling is perfect.
