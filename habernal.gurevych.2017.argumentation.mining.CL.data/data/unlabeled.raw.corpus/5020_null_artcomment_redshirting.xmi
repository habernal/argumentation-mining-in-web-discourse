At first we were going to send her to Transitional Kindergarten, because we were worried about her being the youngest in Kinder, but didn’t want her to be bored in preschool…..but the Governor has proposed to wipe out the program, therefore our district has done away with plans to move forward with it. However…all along our daughter’s preschool teachers have been telling us she is more than ready for Traditional Kindergarten. We have now gone ahead and enrolled her, and infact had her assessed at a private school, which we just found out she got into (we are going to go public however, as we also lotteries into a great school). What I learned is that my daughter is more ready than I am! She wants to go to Kindergarten, and her teachers know she is ready..it is me who is afraid to take this next step in her life, and it is me who has to get over it and have some faith in her! (also not be pressured into holding her just because it appears to be a trend). &#10;My son on the other hand, was born Sept. 2nd, and will miss the new cut off by one day (which will be Sept. 1 his year). We will have no choice but to have him start school when he is almost 6. He is in the 95% for his height, so I worry that he will be a giant towering over his peers…although, I suppose he will be in class with red shirted fall birthday children I am sure. &#10;So my children will be 2 years apart in age, but 3 years apart in school!"/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1552" language="en" documentId="5020" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Aliki" date="March 11, 2012 at 4:06 am" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://womenonthefence.com/2012/03/05/redshirting-the-new-normal/comment-page-1/#comment-15745" topic="redshirting" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="5020" notes="non-argumentative&#10;concerns, worries&#10;no stance" title="Redshirting: The New Normal"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1100"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="1101" end="1478"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="1479" end="1552"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47"/></xmi:XMI>
