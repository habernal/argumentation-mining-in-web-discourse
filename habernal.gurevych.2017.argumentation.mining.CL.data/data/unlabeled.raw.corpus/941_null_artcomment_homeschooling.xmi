SS has the power to investigate if a child is believed to be at risk of harm, and LAs can request that a parent supply evidence of a suitable education. The definition of a suitable education is to some extent up to the parents, as is correct, for children do not (yet) belong to the state. &#10;It is currently the parents responsibility to ensure that their child receives an education suitable to age, ability and aptitude and any special needs they may have, and LAs are answerable to parents, not the other way around. This is as it should be. &#10;Despite digging as hard as he could, Badman could find no evidence to link child abuse/ forced marriage or anything else to home education - his stats where he claims HE children are twice as much at risk are beyond dubious. Please inform yourselves by reading the wide variety of submissions to the select committee inquiry into the conduct of this review, released yesterday. You might want to get a cup of tea first though, there are 184 of them. &#10;Home educators do not isolate their children but they also do not accept the idea that socialisation is provided by putting 30 children of a similar age in one room and insisting that they follow the strictures of the adult at the front. They may not provide an education that follows the national curriculum, but they provide one that they consider suitable for their individual children, and they don't interfere in what other ppl are doing for their children. &#10;I might not agree with other parents that school is the best place for children, but I'm not out there blockading school gates and campaigning against them. Leave me to my choices too please.
