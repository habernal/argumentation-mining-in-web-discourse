Me and my mates still share the memories of good old year 7 days and the girls we use to chase after, our very first dates to the local maccas after school. The good memories. &#10;But on the serious side. I used to date a girl who used to go to an all girls school when I was in high school. My gf at the time and her friends were pretty &quot;anti social&quot; around guys (they just didnt seem to know how to communicate with other guys) and when it got to that age (around 17 and 18) when they started to drink alcohol and go clubbing they thought that the only way to get a guys attention was to act slutty around them. Most of the girls I went to high school with didnt really act slutty or anything like that, they seemed to be able to communicate with guys better and realise that you don't need to act slutty to get guys attention (they seemed to get over that stage in their early years of high school). &#10;Since I have been at uni, I have come accross a few girls who went to an all girls school who again, don't really seem to be able to interact with guys. But then again, some of these girls have had a pretty sheltered life and some of them have really been influenced by religion and strict parenting too. &#10;I forgot to mention, my gf at the time and her friends, were extremely bitchy too. Not only that, they seemed to be pretty naive around guys who they don't know at nightclubs.
