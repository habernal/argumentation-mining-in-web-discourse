I also have the unique experience as a defence kid of attending over 13 schools, both here and overseas, and both public and private, and I can honestly say hand on hear that I will never regret my decision to go public. &#10;My teen went to private primary, and graduated with limited literary skill - less than the local public one. That is with no diagnosed or suspected learning difficulty. It's been the yolk around her neck for her entire high school experience, and one not easily reversed in older years - all because the mother relied on the school to do the teaching. &#10;No amount of money can replace the involvement of parents in their kids holistic education - not just the academics, but social as well. And no amount of money can buy my kids the grounded ability to adapt in a normal society where there are have nots as well as haves, and where they won't have the inherent expectation that mummy and daddy will slave their lives away at the cost of their childhood for their education (and then every electronic device as teens to fill the void). &#10;My 18 year old is set to go to uni, is building a house and is the most reasonable and caring person I know - and attends a low socio-economic high school in the south east suburbs. She knows the value of money and has broad reaching social skills and adaptability. And I couldn't ask for a more supportive group of teachers and staff that truly champion for their kids than those in my public schools. Now tell me I am a bad parent!
