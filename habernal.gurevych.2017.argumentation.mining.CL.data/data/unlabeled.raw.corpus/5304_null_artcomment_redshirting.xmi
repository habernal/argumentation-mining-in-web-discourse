He's graduated from college and I never regretted the decision. &#10;What you really do when you wait that extra year is to GIVE your child another year of childhood. A year to grow and mature. A year to be a kid for a little bit longer. Think about it. Why rush it? When they go early, they go to school at age 4, turning 5, and they graduate at 17. They finish college early and are off in the world as an adult early. For what? They push through (often when they aren't really ready) so they can be on their own sooner? What a very precious gift to give your child one more year of childhood. If you asked anyone..which they would rather have–a year of childhood or an extra year of adulthood, what would they choose? &#10;I think parents are often in a rush to save on daycare and prove that their child is somehow just as smart as their friends' kids. Really, parents need to look at their child and the environment they are placing them in. The &quot;evening out&quot; by 3rd grade the author talks about has also been described to me by teachers, but in a negative way...By 3rd grade, kids who are too young often struggle...if they would have waited a year, school would have been much, much easier for them.
