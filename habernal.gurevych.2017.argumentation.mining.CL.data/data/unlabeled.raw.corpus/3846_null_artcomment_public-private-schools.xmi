When we all know public schools are either dangerous and instead of instilling student s to learn have become a job security agenda to meet testing quotas. It is different with private schools some are religious which teach student moral values and/or have an academic curriculum that surpass the public schools learning scale.  Public schools from 1950’s through 1980’s were considered as an overall an acceptable learning institution. Now it is dangerously pathetic.  Allison Benedikt, you obviously have NOT been to any public middle and/or high schools. The dress code is horrendous, Students are so disrespectful mostly displaying an I don't care.... so don't tell what to do attitude. Then you have teachers that at one time liked teaching but now are exasperated and frankly scared because of the violence, vandalism and gangs in public schools. Teachers lack supplies to teach and are underpaid considering the hike in the cost of living. All the above combined makes a pitiful learning environment. The system can't improve because you would have to have around the clock policemen walking the halls to maintain a respectful and safe environment for both teachers and students. To bring about a change all classes would need to be visually monitored with audio access to maintain a safe learning environment. Misconduct, bullying or violence would be addressed immediately providing safety for all. That solution though a revolting measure to have Big Brother watching has to be better than the mediocre illiterate graduates being handed an undeserved High School Diploma.
