It took him a long time to not feel like it was some sort of value judgement on him as a teacher, or on his profession. I was the one who proposed it first, and who researched it for 3 years, and eventually argued more and more strongly for it. He had a much harder time coming around to it. &#10;BUT, he also knew he had to keep his dedication to his job, his students, and his vocaion from blinding him to his daughter's needs and to the fact that a regular classroom would not be good for her. So, though it took longer for him than it did for me, he eventually came to the conclusion that homeschooling was the best choice for her. It was hard for him to see the faces of his coworkers when he shared that in the spring, and to hear their reactions. But now that we've made the commitment and gotten started, he is as excited as I am about how it is going, and very glad that we've made the choice that we have.
