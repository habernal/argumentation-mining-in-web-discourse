Obama has a goal of turning our country in to a full blown socialist government and his actual actions prove that. This is not me, this is him and his socialist policies.  Ironically, he comes from Chicago and started there as a community organizer.  Take a look at how well those idiots in Chicago are killing each other, but somehow it is all the rich peoples fault that live in New York.   The woman that wrote this article wants to blame all the people with money, or all the people who are responsible and wake up every day doing the right thing. All these little b_stards in school that are gangstas are gangstas because they want to be gangstas. They listen to that foul mouthed crap rap music and claim it is poetry based on their times which is another load of BS because it leads to crimes against women as well as crimes in general.   The reality is these kids are not learning because they straight up do not want to learn and their azz clown parents  could care less teaching them because they are too busy themselves doing illegal activities or being in jail themselves that they could care less. You know what we should do? We should split the country in half where all the liberals and socialists can live out west while all the conservatives live in the east.  everyone out west can be gangstas, live on food stamps and non stop unemployment benefits and devote every penny to their public school system based on their own tax themsleves to death tax system.  Everyone out east including me can have low taxes, create jobs by creating business, have churches and say Merry Christmas instead of Happy holidays etc After tem years we do an evaluation of both sides and see who is the most successful. Assuming you were going to make a bet ahead of time who would you bet on? Never mind, don't answer as I do not want to insult your intellect.
