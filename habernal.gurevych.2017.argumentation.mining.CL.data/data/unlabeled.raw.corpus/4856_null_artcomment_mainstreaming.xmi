There are two issues that I always considered during IEP meetings. For the majority of the children with an IEP, intelligence was not the problem at all! They very easily could compete with and even do better academically than many of the regular education students. I will always remember one of my favorite students my second year teaching was a young man with an IEP full of various recommendations. That young man was the only student I had, in both years of teaching, who never got below a 95 each grading quarter. &#10;The other main issue, however, is behavior. For some of the children with disability, the disability does not affect their academic skills, but does prevent them from feeling comfortable in a big classroom setting with upwards of 35 students and only one teacher available to help them all. I always lovingly said that all my students in my BCPSS &quot;mainstream&quot; classroom were special - just some were more special than others. The news article shares the story of Valerie - it was quite frustrating for me to know that a capable and smart young woman like Valerie would have academically done very well had she been placed in a smaller setting with an educator who had special training and experience for how best to reach Valerie. Well, that and not being the only adult in a classroom with 35 children minimum. &#10;Ultimately, mainstreaming is absolutely the way to go for SOME children. But education is an art, not a science, and there is no panacea that will ever work for every child. For these disability rights advocacy groups to throw all their support behind only one way (mainstreaming) in education shows how little they know about the complicated and beautiful art that is teaching/reaching a child.
