I'm a bit intimidated, jumping into this whole big conversation which seems to be between a few people, but I really wanted to throw in my opinions. Though they may come off as a bit random depending on how the topic is going. &#10;(Background: I was home-schooled throughout my entire life, by my parents. I also visited some home-school groups, and my parents were friends with lots of other home-school families. My family and the people I was educated around were the right-wing Christian types, extremity varying. Mine weren't too crazy. I'm an athiest/agnostic and extremely liberal now, lol.) &#10;My stance on home-schooling is this: If it works for you, great, but if not, oh well. Learn in a way that works for you. &#10;There's a couple things I just want to briefly address that I saw while skimming this thread.&#10;Home-schooling is not bullying free. I was verbally, emotionally, and psychologically tortured by fellow home-school kids that I met through home-school groups and my parents friendships with home-school families. I was pushed down the stairs many times by these people. From those things, I became isolated, depressed, anxious, and was self-harming and had an eating disorder. No one recognized it because my parents were largely in denial, and I didn't exactly have teachers to turn to who noticed those things. I'm not saying AT ALL that being in a public school would have changed how my issues were handled, as I recognize that being in a public/private school doesn't automatically mean someone would have seen what was going on. But I feel like I might have had more of a net to talk to, including people who didn't pass those things off as &quot;a poor relationship with Christ to be solved with family and prayer&quot;. Being home-schooled does not automatically shelter you from drug use or sex. I won't get into this, as this is a family-friendly forum and I have seen some folks 14 and under in this thread. But even an embarrassing lack of education on those topics doesn't shelter you; it just leaves you unprepared, ignorant, and extremely vulnerable to assault, peer pressure, etc. &#10;I find that it's not about which is better. It's more about these factors:&#10;Child's personality/learning style/needs/learning ability Family's overall situation/needs Location (in terms of culture, how good the school is, etc) &#10;Like I said. If it works for you, yay! If not, nbd. It's all just a matter of preference and at the end of the day a debate doesn't change the differences in how people learn or how they will best function socially. &#10;I'm sorry that this post is so long, haha. ;;;;"/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2689" language="en" documentId="453" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="kaitlynleliel" date="November 09, 2013 05:33" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://nanowrimo.org/forums/age-group-teens/threads/128227?page=10" topic="homeschooling" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="453" notes="" title="Homeschooling - debate"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="323"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="324" end="692"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="693" end="814"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="815" end="908"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="909" end="2197"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="2198" end="2272"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="63" sofa="1" begin="2273" end="2424"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="2425" end="2641"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="71" sofa="1" begin="2642" end="2689"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59 63 67 71"/></xmi:XMI>
