Also there is no &quot;gender gap&quot; amongst home educated children. I don't know if there has been any research about racial differences. Yes, these are generalisations, but based on scientific studies of large numbers of children. There will always be individual children who do much better (or much worse) than the group they are &quot;lumped&quot; with in these studies. Neither does it mean that home education is the best option for every child - that is for their parents to decide - but there is absolutely no reason for home educating parents to feel they are short-changing their children in any way at all. &#10;The home ed community in England is actually very diverse - with a range of beliefs about religion, politics, and every other topic under the sun. Some of these beliefs are strongly held (think about the strength of character needed to educate your children differently to most other people, in spite of the peer pressure from other parents - and the reasons for this become obvious). But there is also a LOT of acceptance and respect for other people who have different views - including those who send their children to school. The vast majority of home educators do have some experience of school. Not all of this experience is positive - but there is generally an appreciation that school does suit some children and some families, and that this is a perfectly valid choice for another family to make. What suits one child might not suit another, we also appreciate that different schools can be very different from one another. &#10;This is in sharp contrast to the prejudice home educators often experience from those who don't home educate - who make all kinds of assumptions about what is involved and what the results will be (especially when it comes to peer group socialisation and exams). Learning to deal with other people's prejudice and assumptions is often the hardest thing about home educating. &#10;Many people are very encouraging to home educators, and there are a lot of positive comments as well - but anyone wishing to home educate in this country would do well to develop a thick skin, as the negative comments/prejudice do hurt, especially in the early days. I think that many of the comments are actually well-meaning, but sadly many parents feel threatened by another family's decision to home educate, they think that the HE family are making some sort of statement that everyone else should home educate as well, and immediately start to justify their own decision to send their children to school. &#10;I personally think this is a shame - we are ALL trying to do our best for our children, and absolutely no reason to criticise another parent who chooses to do things differently. &#10;I have 4 children, who were home educated for part of the time &amp; went to school for part of the time. Home ed was fantastic, and so are both of the schools my children currently attend.
