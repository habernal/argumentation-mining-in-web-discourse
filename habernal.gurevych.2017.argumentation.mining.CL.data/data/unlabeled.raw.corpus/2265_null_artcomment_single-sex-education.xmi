Now I am the parent of a six year old boy and I can assure you that his developmental trajectory and that of many of his male peers is noticeably different from most girls. He is in a school that teaches to the &quot;norm&quot; and here in California that means reading and writing at age five. He's wasn't ready nor were many of the other children in his class (many of the boys). Why are the (mostly) boys put into a situation that does not honor their development? Isn't that the whole nature of civil rights - that we respect and foster diversity? I would love to have him in a class full of other boys, I know he would have more freedom and less pressure to learn like the girls. The ACLU is misguided - the system as it stands is quite discriminatory. It is just that it is discriminatory against (most) boys and that is why their academic success is plummeting. &#10;In a nutshell, while mandatory single sex education is certainly discriminatory, optional single sex education when done correctly is inclusive and respects diversity. Many of the historical cases in this area involved higher ed - VMI and The Citadel for example - and the problem was that only males had access to this form of FREE education. It is a different ball of wax when talking about offering options at the primary level.
