However, the author really lacked any ability to really make a point.  The only thing she succeeded in was highlighting how much of this is her opinion....after all...how often did she use the term &quot;bad parents&quot; when discussing parents sending their children to private school. The parents sending their children to private schools are RARELY located close to the bad ones.  I don't know of anyone in the Columbus area who is well off enough to afford a private school that are live in the same district as the bad ones.  Normally, poor public schools are in poor areas.  So her logic is flawed on that She seems bent of trying to blame parents not participating in public schools for the problem of public schools.  she conveniently forgets all those other factors....like for instance the education system and the involvement of government. I'm not rich...not even close...but I would like to think all the adults in this country are getting tired of everything being blamed on them. Like all those people who trashed Romeny for his offshore bank accounts....how many of you have iphones? Ever hear about how Apple does its business?
