As someone else has posted, historically the union of church and state (forcing religious views on society) always ends up disastrous no matter how good the intentions. Since 1999, there have been 31 school shootings. Anyone who denies that the removal of God from our public school system is not the cause of the senseless tragedies currently evident is just being willfully blind. Wake up!! Open your eyes as well as your hearts. Quit being stupid/foolish. Yes, it is the parents responsibility to teach the children about the Lord at home, however all kids are not as blessed or fortunate to be reared by God-fearing parents and guardians. Thus, God being taught in schools brings divine power into the lives of the youth who need Him so desperately, and who otherwise may not even receive such life-changing instruction. I suppose some of you would rather your children turn into mass murderers, thugs, pimps, or successful, indifferent citizens unconcerned with eternal things. Watch yourselves because we will have to give an account of our behaviors relative to the things of God, spirituality, and eternity. We will seal our eternal fates right here on Earth as this is a practice life for the eternal life to come. God loves each and every one of us so much that He was willing to give it all up for you and for me. His mercy will not always strive with man. One of these days, Earth will be no more. All of the pain and abuse and destruction and corruption will indeed be wiped out. Obeying God, studying His word, praying and living in His will, seeking His counsel is the only way we will ever make it……Kicking Him out means allowing the enemy in……how foolish can man continue to be????
