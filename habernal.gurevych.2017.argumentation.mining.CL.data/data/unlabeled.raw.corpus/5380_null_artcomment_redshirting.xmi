I have seen many kids go into this situation and as I volunteered 3x a week I was stunned by kids that were in the class. Many had no clue about abc’s let alone how to spell. Let’s not forget there are parents who could not afford to send their children to pre-school and these children were thrown into the big k. They survived and they WILL learn from the teachers in class and hostility and anger, tantrums all get handled. I honestly could never do this with a class of small kids. I was just amazed how awesome these teachers are and how calm they react to a situation and teach and guide them to make better choices. As for being loud, haha! We live in the same household…..my little guy sorry not little will be 9 is on his own megaphone that I have to tell him VERY often shhhhh tone it down or mommy won’t listen. Now it’s you are yelling! He will tone it down. I am with you, glass of wine please. Can’t fix this nor make them aware of it, all slam doors and speak loudly nothing like how we were raised. Not a peep to ne heard when parents were asleep. Who am I kidding we were not to ne heard period. I think the only time I can remember being heard was pool play “Marco-polo” and us rolling around in the hallways on the huge feather pillows. So with that being said I can very much relate to all the anxieties, I promise Ryan will be fine and awesome! He will love it! Kids want to grow and learn and honestly it’s so fast paced he won’t be bored.
