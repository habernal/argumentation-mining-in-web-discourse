I find this idea mysterious. In school one mixes with around 30 other children of the same age, plus a handful of adults who are given an artificial role in loco parentis, plus a few hundreds or thousands of others with whom one will probably never interact. I don't see how this can possibly be described as an effective or even a desirable environment for socialisation. The whole situation at school is contrived and artificial and bears little relation to what these children will experience once they escape its confines. How is it then helpful in preparing them? &#10;I also wonder what on earth we did before schools. What a lot of unsocialised yobs we must have been. &#10;Calminthestorm:&#10;Again, school involves interaction with a specific set of children, and the removal any real interaction with adults. Why is this a good thing? And if it is so good, why do so many children emerge from school still unable to deal with difference and indeed prejudiced against certain races/sizes/intelligence levels/etc specifically because of their experiences? &#10;I would be interested to know what the holders of this view think of, for instance, small schools like the one I went to in Orkney which had 6 students? Or public schools which are populated by predominately (often exclusively) rich, upper middle class children? These have severely limited sets of people to interact with. Are they 'cruel' too? Should they be banned? &#10;I'm not sure I have noticed many here who have professed to dismissing the whole system for the reasons you state, though there surely are some around. In my experience, the parents who are most likely to dismiss the education system as a whole are those who work in it - teachers, school governors and the like. It has generally come from years of doggedly fighting that system to try and give the children in their care the best education they can, and realising that they don't have to trust their own offspring to such restrictions, lotteries and vagaries. &#10;CharleySays:&#10;I'm not sure what your point is. Are you saying it's impossible for children to gain skills in dealing with fat/thin/tall/short/bright/slow people unless they are in school? Or are you generalising based on a couple of kids you have met whose backgrounds you don't know? Surely you don't believe there are no school kids that 'don't mix well' with other children? If I cited some of them that I know, would I be correct in opining that school is a Bad Thing as a result?
