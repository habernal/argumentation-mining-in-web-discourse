My family is not and was not wealthy.. Working middle class. As a matter of fact, my parents had divorced and my mom deemed it necessary to have me out of Atlanta Public Schools. My entire family, aside from myself, went to Atlanta Public Schools and did fairly well. I was a trouble maker and seemingly a Christian private school was my only saving grace. While it still took one full school year to get it right.. By 10th grade I was flying high. Got on honor roll for first time. Started playing every sport. Student Government. You name it.   I became the first on my mom's side to graduate from a 4 year institution with a Bachelor's degree. I was just about the only one that didn't have kids out of wedlock. I have my own business. Married and now expecting my first child at 31.   So, in closing, does private school work for some people, most certainly does.. Not for all. I know many that were just there for the prestige and location and name. Some of the private school kids are just as awful. They just turn out to be WHITE COLLAR CRIMINALS.   I will strive my hardest to place my son in one of the top private schools in Atlanta. Atleast for the early years.. up to 5th grade. Those are critical learning ages and not time to play around with bad kids, their bad parents, and impatient teachers.
