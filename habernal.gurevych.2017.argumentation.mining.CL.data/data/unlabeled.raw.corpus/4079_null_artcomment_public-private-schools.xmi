If I took that approach I would be saying my hope that the public schools would get better is more important than my child's education.   Private schools and Public schools are available in most states, and many of those states that have great public school systems are NOT affected by the attendance of those that choose the private schools!    Therefore, putting a great big hole in your theory.  Public Schools still get our taxes so they have the same amount of funding they would if the private school kids attended their school.  There are couple good public schools in Jefferson County and there is a HUGE waiting list to get in those two schools.  Outside of that you have to move outside of Jefferson County.  Many Oldham county parents send their kids to private schools too yet they still have a good public school system.  Anchorage has a good public school system and yet they have many in that area that go to private schools.  Male High School is the coveted Jefferson County School and if I could have gotten my kids up through the 1,200 kids waiting to get in they would be have attended Male.  Seems like the powers that be need to fashion the other Jefferson County Schools after Male.  Now, if the schools that aren't performing didn't get the same $$ as those that are performing maybe, just maybe things would change.
