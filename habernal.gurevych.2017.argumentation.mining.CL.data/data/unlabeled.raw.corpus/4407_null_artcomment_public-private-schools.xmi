I have found that (other than a few selective students) 95 % of recruits in leading companies are now privately educated. I suspect it's the same in other professions. Additionally private schools in our state are (again after selective) consistently ahead in HSC results. Local schools are overcrowded and there is no sign of investment on the horizon. It probably is a self fulfilling movement. If it wasn't before it sure is now. We should have invested more in schools earlier to stop it. Education is one of (if not the) great levellers, moving people out of disadvantage, and bringing the whole country up. Like negative gearing, it will take a generation to wind back. Otherwise we are engineering a class divide into society. &#10;Great response - shifts out the ego and emotions, and just leaves the objective truth. I do note that few of the respondents so far have really defended public schools as great places of education, preferring to attack the choice of private schools. &#10;don't underestimate discrimination against public educated graduates, or as it is better known - the old boy network. These same industries also have a low proportion of women in senior roles, proof that woman are also inferior academically? &#10;At one place I worked a colleague said &quot;We should employ [this person] because they went to Trinity. That's a good school.&quot; To which I replied &quot;Yes, if you like getting wood stuck up your arse.&quot; &#10;And what do you base your statistics on? Last time I hired someone, I didn't see any mention of which school they went to. And neither my boss nor I asked them which school they went to. All I needed to know about their education was what they did at university - and that was clearly mentioned in the CV. &#10;Hi A Reader - in recruitment I see people's CVs every day. They all have the school on them."/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1889" language="en" documentId="4407" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="X" date="September 04, 2013, 6:50AM" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://www.theage.com.au/comment/private-schools-and-the-art-of-ripping-off-parents-20130903-2t357.html" topic="public-private-schools" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="4407" notes="" title="Private schools and the art of ripping off parents"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="799"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="800" end="1050"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="1051" end="1293"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="1294" end="1489"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="1490" end="1796"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="1797" end="1889"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59"/></xmi:XMI>
