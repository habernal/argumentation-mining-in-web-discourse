Luckily, in my state, public charter &amp; public studio schools are coming online that will support our child in this manner. The traditional Public School environment only bored my spouse and I. We were active and very smart children, only to be beaten down by the typical Public School environments of the times we were advancing in age to adulthood. I did my research into Private v. Public schools simply because I was looking for a school within walking distance, and, was surprised to find, in my state, Public Schools provide the best bang for the buck. Additionally, a Public School will afford me a couple more years as Stay At Home Parent, and, we won't have to a. take out loans for elementary school tuition, or b. worry that our kids teachers are underpaid.   I disagree with providing parents vouchers to go to a private school they can afford (in our state, private schools pay their teachers significantly less, and, most private schools tend to be religiously affiliated. I went to a religious school, I know what they do to their females, and, I know a religious school's primary aim is to increase its congregation.), but, do not mind the idea of a tax credit as we were almost forced to send our kid to a private school and I do know we would have been paying 2X for our kid's education. I don't know the perfect answer.   It seems a sizable percentage of parents are so busy doing everything else other than being involved with their children that the parents get what they deserve. As an older parent, I have seen how my peers children have turned out, and, over all, the problem has not been the educational system, the problem has been with the parents. First and foremost, most parents are more than willing to give up raising their very own children from ages 0-5, the most formative years of the lives of humans. But, then, the USA's current culture does not support parents in the early days of the lives of the little humans parents choose to create. Of course, parents have allowed this disrespect of the unpaid job of parenting to remain in place...most my age and younger have no idea how hard the job of parenting fulltime from age 0-5 really is...hence the continued disrespect...   When we went to 4K, it was very obvious to me which children were parent or mostly parent/family raised from ages 0-5, and which children were daycare raised. Then, amongst the daycare raised, it was obvious who had good childcare providers and those that did not. Luckily, by the time my kid's 4K class ended, all the children had been brought to an equal status.   I think the USA has to put Pride In Parenting, and, provide support to those who would parent their own children from ages 0-5. So far, all I know is, as Stay At Home Parent, it is assumed I 'opted out' rather than chose (by mutual decision between my spouse and I) to be Stay At Home Parent. Until there is more pride in parenting, I posit, the Public Schools will continue to be allowed to further disintegrate as already allowed by my peers and elders.
