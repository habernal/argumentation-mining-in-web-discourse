Its better known for its drug and drive by shootings than that of a middle class neighborhood where a politicians visit is as scarce as their representation or support. &#10;The Public school teachers in my area are as good as those of private schools, but they lack support particularly when there is a huge mix of cultural diversity and English is not the primary language at home. &#10;Do Not criticise parents for their choice of a any sort of education. Public education supporters need to remember their children get their education for free. Its NOT your money we're spending,its our own &#10;Actually Steve, The whole point is that taxpayer funds are being spent to subsidise private education. I have no problem with people sending their kids to private school but why should that be subsidised by the government? &#10;Government money should be spent providing a top quality State education system.&#10;If people want to send their kids to private schools they should pay for that with their own funds. &#10;Andrew, Factory workers who send their kids to non Government schools pay as much tax as parents who can easily afford it and leech off the public school system. &#10;It should be noted that If children could attend any state school of their choice rather than being confined and divided to what area we geographically live in. It would be an entirely different matter for many, the howls of protest would be loudest from the public sector parents. &#10;I'm afraid that public school supporters forget who the snobs really are. God forbid that kids from poor families from socially low economic areas who can least afford it take up class places next to kids from the wealthier leafy suburban or city public schools.
