It was different for both of them. I think if each of them didn't have their particular outlets as part of their curriculums the rest wouldn't fall into place for them so easily - if that makes sense? Certainly there is a good amount of self-motivation at work. But I am 100% certain for example that if oldest DD didn't have a certain set of what they call &quot;Career clusters&quot; (What we called electives) to look forward to every day - to balance out her core classes that she wouldn't be so motivated. &#10;As Tinker mentioned too - I think MI plays a huge part. My girls are both very artistic and musical. They are very led and motivated by music and can really motivate themselves and focus where music is involved. &#10;But to answer your question - would my opinion change - to be honest - no. Maybe I wouldn't have let them go on their own in middle school but I think by the time they are seniors in high school they have to be able to foster their own education and do those things for themselves. I don't think they should go to college and be unable to speak to their professors on their own behalf and as seniors in high school they should be practicing those skills. And having seen for myself how many of today's recent college grads are going into the workforce unable to fend for themselves without mom I think that the earlier in their teens we're able to start teaching this skill with any consistency and retention, the better off we'll all be.
