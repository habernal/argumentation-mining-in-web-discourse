The quality of state schools is highly variable, often according to the demographics in the catchment area, and (for secondary schools) the proportion of locals sending their children to private schools. I live in Melbourne's inner east in the so-called private school belt, and our local state primary has the deserved reputation of being one of the state's best, and most local children attend. The school is well-resourced, has great grounds, teachers and excellent financial support from the mostly affluent parents. &#10;The state high school next door is different. As most locals go to private secondary schools, the catchment area is much larger. Most of the students are from disadvantaged backgrounds in the inner city, and/or have English as a second language (I don't mean this in a classist or racist way, simply that classes can be impacted by having children who are disengaged, or who are engaged but struggle with the language). Its NAPLAN results are unsurprisingly significantly worse for year level than the local state primaries, and the facilities are nowhere near as good, because the parents don't have the money to support the school or the interest and connections for fundraising. I find this very sad for the children who attend, particularly given the contrast with the primary school. I support state schooling in principle, but I will not be sending my daughters there because they will not get the same quality of education they will receive in private school. &#10;Is this wrong? Probably, but like many other parents, I won't disadvantage my kids for a principle. And so the problem continues...
