He never went to school, as we originally had a &quot;parental choice&quot; of 1 local school with a bad reputation. &#10;It was hard work and my wife did most of it as I work full time. It is, for example, hard to switch between the roles of teacher and parent in the 10 second walk from the living room to the rest of the house. &#10;The local authority was zero help. They have huge discounts on books and meterials, which they are not willing to let home educators access. &quot;An old, used copy of the National Curriculum? Certainly ,sir, that will be £60... &quot; &#10;We put up with all the years of odd looks and occasional snide and disapproving comments. We explained patiently (and endlessly) that &quot;Yes&quot; we teach at home. &quot;No&quot; we are not qualified teachers. &quot;Yes&quot; we take great care to give him opportunities for making and keeping friends. &quot;Yes&quot; we arrange for him to do sports and exercise. &quot;No&quot; it's not against the law&quot; and finally (and more recently) &quot;No&quot; we are not actually child abusers. &#10;When you finally come to take exams, then you find virtually no school or college will help. All they have to do is order one extra exam paper and let you know when your child has to turn up (for which you then pay them a lot of money) but most just can't be bothered. We ended up having to do an hour and a half's drive each way for every exam, and bear in mind that many GCSEs these days require two or three exams per qualification! &#10;Anyway, the end result is a well balanced, well rounded, fit, friendly and confident young man who got all A and A* GCSEs, and is now studying at the local 6th form college - and making more new friends. &#10;So the moral of the story is that, done properly, it is extremely effective and extremely rewarding - for kids of any colour, BUT it is very hard work, costs quite a lot and almost no-one will help you. But we're happy with our decision and would do the same again...
