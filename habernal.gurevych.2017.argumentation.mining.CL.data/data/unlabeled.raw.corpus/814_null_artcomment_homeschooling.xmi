And so eager to jump onto the &quot;socialisation&quot; bandwagon. &#10;It is often because of the horrendous social life at a school that parents choose to take over in the first place. Poor standards being a close second. Religion is usually way down the line, if at all. &#10;The only place schooled children can &quot;socialize&quot; is in the playground, mostly unsupervised. This is more of a Lord of the Flies scenario than anything positive or desirable. &#10;Children who don't have to go to a school can instead choose their friends from people who live locally or have the same interests and hobbies that they do. At every single club my daughter has ever gone to, the tutors have commented on how easy she is to teach, and how enthusiastic she is to learn, and she has always got on easily with the other children. &#10;When she's not at a club, she has time to simply be a child. No peer pressure or dread of Monday morning. All her schooled friends are envious of her, and, as she has so many more life skills than they, defer to her knowledge in loads of areas. Not to say that she's academically any better than they are, or would get good exam passes, but she definitely has skills employers will want and I suspect these days that that is more important. &#10;It's funny to think that some readers think the writer is &quot;brave&quot; or wish her luck - in fact if children attend a school it is more likely that they will need the luck in order to survive the system. &#10;Education of children by family members used to be normal, maybe one day in the future it will become so again. The figures are certainly rising year by year, small wonder.
