It is interesting to note also that private schools often 'cream' the less capable teachers from the public system as they are unable to train their own. &#10;The rise of the Australian private school poses problems for Australian society as it could well giving a false sense of superiority to those who attended a very ordinary private school. &#10;The fact is most parents are not sending their child to private school for academic results. The truth is they just think it is a safer enviroment for there child. Simple as that. &#10;The author is happy to send her child to a middle class public school ask her to send it to one of the worst in the state and see if her words match her actions. No wayyou she put her precious in a school like that. &#10;I attended a govt primary and one of the most expensive private schools in Australia for high school. My assessment on the merits of the teachers and the 'safety' of the schools is that they would be comparable. My private high school had many 'lifers' as teachers who had been there for 30-40 years and hadn't progressed in their teaching philosophies since the 1960's, they cared little for the children and were seemingly counting down the days to retirement. Re safety well it depends, if your child is the least bit effeminate or even sensitive then I'd advise against sending them to an all boys sporting based private school as it will be hell for them and their physical and mental well-being would be tested. &#10;I agree with abc.&#10;It's not only about sending your kids to the best school academically. it's about the students In the school and the fact that private schools are more pro-active in kicking out troublemakers. &#10;When i was in primary school. I went to a public school and got bullied. My mother changed my school 3 times to stop bullying. The 3rd public primary school i went to was the worst. I had kids putting sand in my food and i had one boy who straight out punched me. Told the school. The boy punched a girl and They did NOTHING. &#10;So in 4th grade My mother finally took me to a private school. From the very first day i got there. I finally felt accepted. There was no bullying. Everyone was friends with each other.. &#10;Naturally i went to a private high school and witnessed the same. There were arguments and teen drama but i did not witness any bullying with anyone. It was very strict and if you were caught bullying. You get kicked out of the school. Hence all the students there were good kids. Yes i have seen several students being kicked out of the school. &#10;I would not hesitate to send my kids to a private school. I personally do not care if the education is better or not but from my own experience, Private schools are more pro-active in making sure the bad kids comply by the rules or get kicked out.
