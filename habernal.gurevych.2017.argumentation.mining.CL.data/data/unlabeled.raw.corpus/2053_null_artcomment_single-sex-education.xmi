Through personal experience with friends from public school I have heard complaints on my abilitiy to talk to girls with such ease. You have more girl friends than I can even count, a close friend of mine would say that goes to a Co-Ed High school. I believe that people have forgotten about this simple aspect of American life called The weekend. This glorious time of the week WHERE STUDENTS ARE NOT IN SHCOOL. Clubs that do provide great oppurtunities to meet people from other schools. Social contacts are exchanged and friends are formed. This is how I met my prom date and current girlfriend The serperation to interact with girls in a more fun enviornment such as the mall or movies didn't conflict with my focus needed in the classroom. The most amusing arguement I saw was Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Students in single-sex classrooms will one day live and work side-by-side with members of the opposite sex. Educating students in single-sex schools limits their opportunity to work cooperatively and co-exist successfully with members of the opposite sex. Right after high school I was offered the oppurtunity to do office work where most of the staff is female. This arguement holds no water considering that myself, and past classmates who were also offered jobs at other institutions, work just find with female co-workers. We hold a sense of professionalisim that these critics failed to comprehend. Another fun arguement against single sex schools is the maturity of Boys. Oh those crazy ravid immature boys. People making this arguement need to mature themselves. I have noticed more immature and emotional drama come from co-ed schools than I observed from my own school. Of course immature jokes are exchanged amongst my peers, but the same can be said from all sorts of enviornments. Like said before, a sense of professionalisim is applied to the proper situatuion, and distinguishing the diffrence between co-ed and single sex, I see the ability to differentiate the proper and imporper situations is more evident in single sex than that of co-ed schools. Coming from a teenage boy that scored 2100 on his SAT's, full time college student, part time job as a student intern, I hope parents do not disregard single sex schools as an option for their children. The enviornment is unique, warm, and can provide oppurtunities you would have never thought possible for your child. A 15 an hour job right out of highschool and a 10,000 scholarship, all coming from a student from a single parent household isn't to bad.
