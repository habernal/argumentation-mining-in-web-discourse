To exclude any of them is to deminish the value of their beliefs. Catholics believe Jesus is a God while the Jewish people believe Jesus was a holy man. I'm guessing there are as many self-proclaimed Christians that are actually Jewish because they really don't believe Jesus is a God. What religion are these people? They definitely exist and are a significant population! So what portion of the public school system books should they occupy? &#10;There are dozens of Christian religions, including the Mormons who believe that one day Jesus will return and take all his &quot;True&quot; followers to another planet to live upon. &#10;Just because a religion has a significant number of self-professed followers, doesn't mean they are correct, or significant. &#10;Who is going to interpret the writings of these religious texts to make sure the entries into the text books are not vague or misrepresented? &#10;There are thousands of learned people studying the Bible today trying to sort out what was actually meant by the writings. If learned people for 2,000 years have not been able to sort out the Bible by now, what gives anyone the right to force it down the throats of children and confuse them their entire lives? &#10;Reading, writing, arithmetic, and perhaps classes to prepare kids for trades and college. There is enough room for debate on these pressing issues without forcing religious diversity into the classrooms. &#10;If a &quot;family&quot; declares themselves to be a particular faith, then their children should be given time to leave the classroom for their religious services, but should have to make-up any work to be missed. &#10;Native Americans have 3-day religious festivals several times a year. The kids are kicked out of BIA colleges if they attend their festivals. &#10;So I believe they should be allowed the time off to pursue their beliefs, but not to be taught about religion in schools. There are too many variables that would interfere with the teachings parents believe are appropriate for their children. &#10;Just because a particular religious group believes in blood-letting as a sacrifice to God, does not make it an appropriate thing to be taught in public schools for children (Catholics in the Phillipines believe in blood-letting as a sacrifice). Children are very prone to unreasonable influence at early ages. They would kill themselves out of misunderstanding, as when children are given hand grenades with pulled pins to carry to the enemy. They do it without knowing why. &#10;If you want your children taught a religion, put them in private schools. And realize the religion they are taught won't be the one you would teach yourself. Anyone who sends their children to school to be taught a religion, is in my opinion, too lazy to teach their children themselves. &#10;Putting the afterlife of your children in the hands of someone &quot;you think&quot; is more learned about the thoughts of God, is akin to giving custody of your children to a baby sitter. If the baby sitter teaches a bad or destructive habit, you the parent are still responsible; and accountable before God. &#10;So define for me the entire definition of the word &quot;Love&quot;! You can not. Libraries of books are written and that one word can not be fully expressed in writing. &#10;So do you really believe a single thought of God could be expressed adequately in any book?&#10;The Bible are the vague beliefs of men, not God. So why put your faith in a document that has been manipulated for 2,000 years and still does not provide any valuable information about God? Social inspiration is combined with religious comments to make a seemingly inspired teaching. When the only inspirational portion of the bible has to do with issues of social interaction.
