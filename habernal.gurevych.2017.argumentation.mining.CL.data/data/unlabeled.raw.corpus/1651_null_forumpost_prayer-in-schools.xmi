If you find a similar law in the Christian beliefs as well as the Federal laws , it is safe to say that you would find the same law among many different belief systems and not exclusive to Judaeo-Christianity. These are the laws against murder , theft, and so on. The very same you will find in Paganism, and non-sectarian societies. &#10;When one gets to the basic laws and ideals in the Bible, you will find that the US Constitution and that book are very much at odds. So much so that I would state that there is no way any part of the US legal system can claim to have come from Christianity. &#10;The very first commandment that Moses brought down from the mountain is:&#10;&quot;You shall have no other gods before me.&quot; **&#10;You have a direct conflict with the First Amendment of our constitution which reads:&#10;&quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&quot; *** &#10;If the Constitution and laws of this land were taken from the Bible, this surely wouldn't have been allowed. Matter of fact the idea of men, not God, making and enforcing laws is foreign to the Bible. &#10;In addition Biblical law would never allow for freedom of speech (blasphemy), redress of grievances to the lawmaker (arguing with god's laws), ending of Slavery (slavery is endorsed in both the OT and NT), The taking of oaths, the allowance of non-believers and Heretics into the population, and even stating that all are afforded equal rights are things that go against the Bible and its teachings. &#10;While I agree that the nation has not fallen under Theocratic rule (yet), you really cannot call this a &quot;Christian Nation &quot;. More truthful would be to say a Nation with a Christian majority. Indeed the words &quot;Christian Nation&quot; call up fears that it would resemble Iran or Iraq under Islamic rule. the non- Christians are still free for now to openly proclaim their religion or lack of. That there are certain sects who wish to bring such things to fruition is a subject for another time. &#10;Laws and ethics need not come from some religion. Indeed the most basic laws for our nation came from Greek and Roman Laws, from the great writers of the Enlightenment (Locke, Blackstone) and even from the the leaders of the Iroquois Nation. The influence that Christianity had on the forming of our country was secondary. That is one of the things that makes the Great Experiment that is known as the United States so unique. &#10;**Ten Commandment reference taken from: http://www.bible-knowledge.com/10-commandments /&#10;*** Constitutional Reference: http://www.usconstitution.net&#10;&quot;Politicians should wear uniforms like NASCAR drivers so we can identify their corporate sponsors&quot; - Robin Williams "/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="3119" language="en" documentId="1651" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="heathen57@gmail.com" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://www.opposingviews.com/questions/should-prayer-be-allowed-in-public-schools#comment-70270" topic="prayer-in-schools" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="1651" notes="" title="Should Prayer Be Allowed in Public Schools?"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="130"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="131" end="589"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="590" end="848"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="849" end="921"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="922" end="966"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="967" end="1051"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="63" sofa="1" begin="1052" end="1333"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="1334" end="1535"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="71" sofa="1" begin="1536" end="1936"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="75" sofa="1" begin="1937" end="2425"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="79" sofa="1" begin="2426" end="2853"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="83" sofa="1" begin="2854" end="2942"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="87" sofa="1" begin="2943" end="3002"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="91" sofa="1" begin="3003" end="3119"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59 63 67 71 75 79 83 87 91"/></xmi:XMI>
