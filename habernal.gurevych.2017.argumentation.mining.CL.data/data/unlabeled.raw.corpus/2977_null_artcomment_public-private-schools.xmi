Both my brother and I were in private school.  He was in private school since pre-school and I since 7th-grade!  At first, because I have learning disabilities adding Attention Deficit Disorder to the mix, I was in public school.  It was a horrible experience for my parents, though.  I kept &quot;falling&quot; behind in school because of my auditory processing problems and the school board did not care!  By 6th-grade, my teacher had a one-on-one conference with my mother to tell her that she needed to take me out of public school and put me in a private school, if possible.  His fear was that they were going to continue to &quot;brand&quot; me as &quot;slow&quot; when he knew darn right well that I was capable of much more as long as I had that little push that he knew my parents would give.  I think he felt that a lot of the problems had to do with the ADD first, making the rest of it difficult for me as far as processing information and so forth.  It always took me longer then the rest of the class when it came to studying/homework.  But, it did not mean I could not do it.  I think the public school was too &quot;lazy&quot; to bother with us kids that had these issues.  Sad to say, but true, some of the kids that were in my class wound in jail because of drugs.  But, they obviously did not have the same support system I did family-wise.  I HAD SUPPORTIVE PARENTS WHO WERE WONDERFUL PARENTS WHEN IT CAME TO GUIDING ME THROUGH THE ACADEMICS!!!  They did not allow me to give up or &quot;throw in the towel!&quot;  They found &quot;tricks&quot; to keeping me motivated, tricks I still use today if I ever need to!    With that said, my parents both agreed to put me in private school and I thrived!  Both my parents tutored me in all my classes.  My mom tutored me in mostly math and english and my dad in everything else (science was a flip-flop for them depending on what it was we were learning in class at the time because, my mother being a nurse and father being a physician, my father was better at the chemistry part).    So, how dare someone make a public statement saying that putting your child/children in private schools make you a &quot;bad person!&quot;  That is like saying you are a bad parent for putting them in private school.  For me, it was the best decision they ever made for me!  Public school was NOT the RIGHT CHOICE for me!  I definitely would have floundered even with my mother being an advocate and doing her best to take charge.  I don't think it would have been the RIGHT CHOICE for my brother either.  My mother had considered changing schools for him and putting him in public school per his request.  But, she never did because she was afraid that he would get lost, socially, and would be &quot;beaten&quot; up by kids that were rough around the edges due to his personality.  He also liked &quot;dressing up&quot; and all that.  He was that way because of the way we were raised...he enjoyed things like dressing up and going to plays.  She did not think he would last long before coming home in tears with a black eye!  So, public school is NOT for EVERYONE!  It is all according to your child's personality and so forth.  Let me tell you something, if any of my children turn out anything like me, I will definitely not send them to public school.  I would rather spend the extra money to send them to private school from the start while getting them the help they need, outside of school, like tutoring.  I will do whatever I feel is best for my kids and if that makes me a bad person then so be it!
