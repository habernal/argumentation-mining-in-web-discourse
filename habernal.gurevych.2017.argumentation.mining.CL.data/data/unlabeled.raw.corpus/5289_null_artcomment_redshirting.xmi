I agonized over the decision for the first one–a child who was more than ready to start Kindie as a 4-year-old. I was projecting all the issues that could befall her if she was the very youngest or very oldest throughout her school career, but then I took some very good advice: Is she ready to go to Kindergarten right now? The answer was yes, and she is doing great. High academic achiever, lots of friends, just a good experience all the way around. With my second, it was different. He had a health issue that made me think it would be better for him to be a bit more mature throughout his school career and the deal was sealed when his PreK teachers agreed that socially he wasn't quite ready for primetime. He stayed in half-day PreK one more year, and he was clearly &quot;ready&quot; when the Kindergarten start date rolled around the next year. He's never had any issues at all. He is ahead academically, so we do have to work hard to make sure he is being challenged, but, so far, we've had teachers rise to the challenge. Two kids, two individuals, two different decisions, and two good outcomes.
