None of the parties who should care and act (ministers, opposition, media) doing anything, even putting out positive news stories that cover up the truth of what is going on when someone has the integrity to speak up. &#10;This makes education a fraud on many levels, with shocking waste of money and resources by the very sector that is always bleating about needing more money, being compassionate and so on. &#10;What is needed is an open public inquiry into the mismanagement of child and adult education, with strong accountability measures to stop the rot now and take action against all who have abused this system, as per above, and the shoddy other rip-offs of managers being out shopping, doing personal errands, having their hair done etc etc during work time, all year round, year in, year out. &#10;This is what has been killing public education, from the top down and from the inside out.&#10;Media investigation, please!&#10;... tends to happen in union run workplaces.&#10;Actually, it was Kennet's great corporatisation fiasco which gave unfettered access to the trough for anyone who thought they deserved a cushy desk job on a bloated salary and who had failed in the classroom, or found teaching too much like hard work. &#10;Standards plummeted from what they had been (modestly high), nepotism soared and the taxpayer pays through the teeth, including for the &quot; remedial&quot; services after the actual services are so dysfunctional. &#10;Giving power and public money and resources without accountability (and boards that only collect their sitting fees) or checks and balances is just irresponsible, stupid policy. &#10;Politicians would not allow it in their own businesses or for the education of their family - child or adult. But they couldn't care less when the recipients are disadvantaged. This leads to illiterate and innumerate youth and adults unable to work and inter-generational poverty for which the fools responsible then try to point the finger at everyone else. &#10;It is real right now and should be investigated."/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2809" language="en" documentId="4520" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Fish smells from the head" date="September 04, 2013, 10:10AM" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://www.theage.com.au/comment/private-schools-and-the-art-of-ripping-off-parents-20130903-2t357.html" topic="public-private-schools" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="4520" notes="" title="Private schools and the art of ripping off parents"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="95"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="96" end="454"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="455" end="793"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="794" end="1016"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="1017" end="1205"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="1206" end="1597"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="63" sofa="1" begin="1598" end="1688"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="1689" end="1717"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="71" sofa="1" begin="1718" end="1762"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="75" sofa="1" begin="1763" end="2015"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="79" sofa="1" begin="2016" end="2221"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="83" sofa="1" begin="2222" end="2400"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="87" sofa="1" begin="2401" end="2760"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="91" sofa="1" begin="2761" end="2809"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59 63 67 71 75 79 83 87 91"/></xmi:XMI>
