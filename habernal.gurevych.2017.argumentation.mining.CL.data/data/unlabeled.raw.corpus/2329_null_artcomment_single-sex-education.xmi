It is becoming well-known that the situation for young black males is nothing less than a crisis, but the situation for young males in general is something that needs national attention as well. &#10;When will we get it? Boys and young men are in trouble. Let’s stop talking about all the mature men at the top, and look at our young men – who don’t do nearly in well as school as their sisters, who are less likely to go to college, and who often waste much of their time in non-productive pursuits. Leonard Sax’s book, Boys Adrift, is among several that look at this important issue. &#10;I don’t know if single sex schooling is the solution, but something must be done to inspire and motivate our sons and grandsons the way we have in recent decades inspired and motivated our daughters and granddaughters. &#10;In July 1996 this paper published a letter I wrote in which I took issue with New York City’s plans for an all-girls school. I wrote that “…The most recent annual report of the New York State Education Department shows, as it has for years, that girls outperform boys on a variety of measures. Girls get higher grades, score higher on Regents exams and enter college in larger numbers. At the other end, suspension rates are much higher for boys. They also have a higher dropout rate. &#10;It may be that girls will do even better in an all-girls school. But an unbiased observer looking at the data would have to conclude that boys should be a more immediate concern.” &#10;The gender gap has only widened in the last 15 years. Maybe single-sex schooling isn’t the answer. But we have to put this question first and foremost in our minds as we look at education: What can we do to help boys and young men begin to achieve something approaching academic parity with girls and young women?
