In real life, it hasn't worked so well for my son.&#10;First of all, we didn't know he had a right to inclusion. We didn't know the questions to ask, period. So he ended up in a segregated, structured special ed. classroom. The first year was great. He made academic gains and seemed very happy. &#10;Then,in first grade, we asked he be placed in inclusive classrooms for non-academic subjects with an aide. By the second semester, it became apparent he was slipping behind academically in his special ed. classes. &#10;He didn't have any friends among the peers without disabilities. He was invited to 1 birthday party of a non-disabled peer (God bless that little girl and her parents!) but no other classmates with disabilities came and the other children stayed away from my son. They weren't actively mean to him - they just gave him a wide berth. &#10;Despite all this, he seemed happy enough with his peers in the special education classroom; he was a bubbly, outgoing, talkative boy. &#10;At his year end IEP, we pressed for appropriate services in the public school. Instead, he was given private placement in a non-public school. &#10;Our contention all along, no matter where he goes to school, is that everyone consider the whole child - not just the academic gains or his emotional well-being but the totality of our son as a person. &#10;In the public school, our son was more well-adjusted with better manners and generally happier, but didn't receive appropriate levels of OT and ST. He also couldn't seem to learn to read. &#10;In the non-public school, while they have more OT and ST and he is making progress academically, he is having behavior problems. &#10;A stark difference is the culture of the non-public school versus the public school. The non-public school has a very unwelcome attitude towards parent involvement, and even to questions and concerns that parents may raise. Hard though it may be to believe, the public school was better on these issues. &#10;The non-public school director has said repeatedly that we are welcome to take our child out of her school since she has a waiting list, whenever we have brought up concerns. (Our biggest concern was the revolving door that teachers were on in 2006/07: 3 teachers quit in 1 year.) Thankfully, the teacher situation seems to have stabilized. Yet, they still seem ill-equipped to deal with behavior problems. &#10;Why can't we find a situation where he is happy AND can receive an appropriate education and related services?
