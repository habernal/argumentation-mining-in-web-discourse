However, we've noticed that the teachers were indifferent to the needs or attention an individual student may require. For this reason we started looking at sending her to a private school. The decision was not taken lightly, and it only came after much deliberation. I understand the argument that others are putting up, but ultimately it was a personal choice of which we had no guarantee on the final outcome. She is now in year 9 and flourishing at a private school, which she has been able to achieve without any tutoring. The maturity in almost every aspect she has displayed in year 7 alone was extraordinary. &#10;I've been schooled in 3 different countries and have not attended private schools. Same goes for my wife. However, when we reflect back on to our school days and the quality of education and attention we received from teachers in public schools, we could not see any evidence of it through our dealings with the local public school. Basic skills / knowledge acquired and expected of an age group through classroom learning was non-existent while assignments were voluntary. I don't know about unions nor do I how it affects teachers, what I do see and hear is that with a few exceptions, teachers don't seem to care or go that extra mile. I understand it's a job, but isn't nurturing students to do their best part of the job description? My experiences with my daughter suggests private school teachers are a little more attentive, (regardless of what the reason is) which I believe is why our daughter is doing so much better now compared to her primary school days.
