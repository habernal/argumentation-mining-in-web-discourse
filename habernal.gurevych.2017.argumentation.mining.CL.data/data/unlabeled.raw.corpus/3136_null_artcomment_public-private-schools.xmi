We struggled with it for as long as we could, but realized we had to make a change.  We cannot 'afford' a private school, per se, but what price do you put on your child's education?  The money we use to have to spend on day care when the kids were younger, is now going to private school tuition so that they are prepared for high school and college.  We just made the change this summer, so our 5th grader just started over at a brand new school. Our decision to switch was purely driven on the lack of education our kids were receiving at the public school.   Furthermore, when I volunteered to come in and speak to the Public School principal about our past concerns, and as to the reason why we were leaving after 6 years, she had no interest in meeting with me. In the end, everyone has their own opinion, or reasoning for their choices, and many times it has nothing to do with being conceited, being too religious, or being discriminatory......it just has to do with getting your child the best education.
