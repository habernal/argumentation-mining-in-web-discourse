I don't know what percentage of HSers choose a religious exemption, but I believe it's the minority. This family is an anomaly to the HS families I've met in the past 11 years, almost none of which have a professional educational background, but choose very rigorous curricula and have very high expectations of their children. Their children also participate in team sports, music lessons, etc. &#10;I have homeschooled my daughter since preschool, she is now 16. She has a car she is paying for, a partime job at a theatrical costuming company and will start classes at Northern Virginia Community College this fall. Additionally, she also has been a Costuming Assistant for local theater companies and is co-chair of our church (Unitarian Universalist, very liberal) denomination's district youth conferences committee. She has also been involved in numerous age-appropriate activities throughout her life. &#10;For one semester in freshman year she attended PS, and was very successful. Her teachers were impressed with her abilities and her maturity. After one semester of the boredom of sitting in classes while teachers tried to control students, doing busy work as homework, listening to students mistreat teachers and each other, as a family we decided PS was a waste of her time. However, she did continue math and science classes at PS for two years, which HS students are 'allowed' by the state. Her Algebra II Honors teacher described her as 'a student of a lifetime'. &#10;She scores in the 90th percentiles on the nationally-normed standardized Stanford tests, which FCPS used prior to SOL tests. She has traveled, during the school year, to Hungary, Italy, Spain, England, Austria, Ireland and multiple times to Mexico and Scotland. &#10;My daughter is, I believe, a more typical Virginia HS student than the young man in this article.
