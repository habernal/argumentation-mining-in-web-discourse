Who do you think you are?  Chastising people for doing what is best for their children.  What is wrong with you!!  Do you even have children?  If so, I suppose they are attending a broken down, unaccredited, school filled with minorities and ghetto bastard children.  I doubt it.  You condescending, fascist.   Let me tell you something……  My daughter goes to a private and  ALWAYS will.  Not matter if I can afford it or not.  I would cut off my arm to pay for her school if I had to just to make sure she isn’t exposed to the children in the public schools in my area.  Are you kidding me.   This article just angers me through and through.  I don’t understand how or why you think that giving children the best that we can is a bad thing.  It’s not up to me to better the lives of other children at my daughter’s expense.  Seriously??  You must be one of those people who think the rich should just give their money away to all of the people supported by government help, don’t even attempt to find and job, and just keep popping out kids they can’t even take care of (and don’t try to) just for the additional government money that they turn around and spend on drugs, alcohol, and partying instead of their children. Guess what!!  Its not my problem and damn sure not my responsibility to take care of those kids, or their lousy parents.  My job, focus and concern, is to make sure my child stays very far away from people like that, and make sure I provide everything that I possibly can for her.  In order to do that, I have to continue to better myself and my career.  NEVER settle for mediocrity in our lives.  ALWAYS push to be better.  As far as anyone else….  I DON’T CARE what they have or what they do.  I pay my taxes.  I pay tuition, very high tuition might I add, and still pay the public school taxes even though my child doesn’t go to school there. Which frustrates me even more.  How about this.. Stop making people with children in private schools pay public school taxes.  Stop making people that are trying to something with themselves pay for people who are not trying to do anything to better themselves or their family.  Stop trying to make people that work hard and have family values make up for the short coming of the people who don’t!!!!!!!!!!! How naive you are!!!!  Needless to say.. You know exactly where I think you should stick your opinion.   J  Have a blessed day moron.
