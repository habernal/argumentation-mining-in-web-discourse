As I have said, many home educators do a wonderful job, and others do not. To want to identify where there is a failing in education, not welfare, I don´t see is so wrong, but many home educators see it as meddling. &#10;Well, that's the rub, isn't it? Who decides what is a &quot;failing in education&quot;? Who decides what is valuable to know and how much of it one should know? Who decides that math is more valuable than art? Or that one language is better to know than another? Or one period of history is more important than another? &#10;Who decides HOW, exactly, to quantify the level of success or failure in whichever Deemed-To-Be-Important subjects? Why do people think test results measure anything other than one's ability to regurgitate information on demand? Who decides what the consequences are if the student if found lacking? Aren't Natural Consequences sufficient? Why do we think some people are better qualified to decide what is valuable than parents - or better yet, the learners? &#10;Why would anyone think that a nameless, faceless, group of self-important bureaucrats is more invested in the quality of life and education of my children than me, the parent? That anyone should think that someone besides myself should have a say in how I educate my child truly boggles my mind. I almost think perhaps that was said without following that concept to its logical conclusion. &#10;For example - should the government decide if you are allowed to be a vegetarian or not? Should we set up committees of people opposed to vegetarianism to come into your home, look in your cupboards; decide if you are getting enough protein, stick needles in your children to decide if they are healthy? And should they come in to your home with no warning, even with no provocation and no complaints that you have done anything wrong? Your kids are happy and healthy, but because that One Really Bad Guy's kids were malnourished, should all vegetarians be monitored? Should you be required to prove to the government that you are competent enough to decide what to feed your children? Or would you find that to be an appalling intrusion into your personal liberty - maybe even &quot;meddling&quot;? &#10;Replace the words &quot;home education&quot; with almost any other - choose a religion, sport, hobby, sexual orientation, eating practice, personal belief - and you can see why us home educators feel so defensive and yes - frightened, by the intrusive, judgmental attitudes we face. &#10;I think people who give their children white bread and processed cheese product are rotten parents. And that parents who let their kids play soccer are irresponsible (links to brain damage, dontcha know). And that everyone should learn to knit, but absolutely no crocheting. Crocheting is stupid. And I don't care that I don't know anything about soccer or crocheting; or that lots of people do those things without injury, and are even HAPPY doing them; I think they are bad and should be banned. Anyone who ever bought Velveeta should have a social worker installed in their house.
