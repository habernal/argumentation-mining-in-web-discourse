Our family grew up in the Kansas City school district.  A friend of my sister who lived next door went to public school, and our family went to the nearby Catholic school.  My sister, who was a year younger than her friend, used to help her with her homework as it was stuff she had already done the previous year.  There was a two year gap in the curriculums.  As a Catholic high school student, we had to do service projects.  As freshmen, we were &quot;tutoring&quot; GED students on stuff we had learned in grade school.  This is not a universal truth, however.  Just across town on the Kansas side of the border, the school systems are fantastic.  With two kids myself now, I no longer live in Kansas City, MO, but just on the other side of the metro in Kansas.  My children will be going to public school. And the disparity isn't a matter of money spent.  Both school districts spend right about $12K per student (which is also about a thousand more than the Catholic high school I went to is charging today).
