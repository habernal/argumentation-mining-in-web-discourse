Involved teachers are another important aspect.  It's hard to argue with the ideal that parents should invest more in their local public education system. Unfortunately, while it is easy to suggest that with enough parental hours any school can become a top tier education system, this argument completely ignores the fact that not every parent has the time to spend hours, days and weeks pushing to make the local schools better. A parent that knows the value of an education, pushes their child to do well, encourages them and helps with homework when they can (without doing the work for them,) and then steps back so that the child takes partial responsibility for their own education is invaluable. I would rather parents are involved in the daily aspect of a child's education than attend endless PTA meetings head-butting each other over what a 'good education' means. Because opinions will vary. It's also hard to argue with the ideal that a 'good' student can help to improve a 'crappy' school. However, what works for some might not work for others. A student with everything going for them in terms of background and support at home might still need something which either a public or private school can't provide. It's easy to suggest that an investment from a committed, time and financially stable, family can also improve a school system. Especially if we saw a lot of these families suddenly folded into a public school system. But that implies that families who send their children to private schools all come from this ideal background. When in fact families who choose private schools are from much more diverse backgrounds than Benedikt seems to imply. They are not all rich, and they are not all two parent households who a parent at home with the free time to invest in championing massive educational overhauls. The truth is, there are a thousand different answers to what would help improve the public education system. At the end of the day parents, and students, have only so much capability to affect the schools in their community. The issues facing public education are massive and different in every school district. Some parents and students are faced with a complex decision when it is time to decided between a public and private school. The monetary and time commitments for a private school sometimes even outweigh what a parent can do for a public school. The decision isn't trivial. To imply that choosing to send a child to a private school is bad or lazy simplifies an issue which is very large and complicated to such a degree that Benedickt is guilty of her own type of 'bad ness;' insulting people with generalities over a very complicated issue. I went to pubic school, my sister went to private. Public school worked for me, it wouldn't have worked for her. Nice to know that we, and our parent had choices. By all means, invest time and interest in your children's education. If you have the time, become involved with their school. And if you know a teacher give them your support and encouragement.
