Private schools compete for attendees by providing a better education and better morals in the education system.  I have a child that can pray in school- an option not allowed in public school.  Behavior is better monitored and an honor code is in use  so that bad behavior has punishments fitting the infraction.  I had children in public schools that were punished for defending themselves against bullies - even the child attacked was suspended.  When a similar incident happened to my other child in a private school the child who started the fight was held responsible not the one who was attacked.  Zero tolerance policies backfire in school. Somehow the repeat offenders are always off the hook and the inexperienced child pays the price.  I have the number of children I can afford t pay for. I do not use any of the funding that public schools would use on my child- they still get the funding from my property taxes. I get nothing and pay extra. My children are better off at my expense which is fine by me. If you think the public school systems needs advocates, by all means have at it. My experience was that my children suffered at the hand of the school system. Contrary to popular beliefs not all teachers are wonderful- the teachers at the private schools were better teachers and cared more than the majority of the teachers my children had in public school. Some of the public teachers were wonderful but the majority were too busy trying to follow the idiotic policies the public system had in place to teach- still others only had jobs because the had seniority.
