First, as point our by others, everyone pays school taxes. Those sending their kids to private schools are paying for both your kids and theirs.  Second, most &quot;wealthy&quot; parents sending their kids to private schools are not in &quot;inner city' schools, but most likely live in relatively affluent districts that are doing fine already. Third: if parents are sending their kids to a religious school, is the public school willing to accommodate their desires? I seriously doubt it. Four: Public schools are hot beds of liberalism. Allison knows that, and she is deeply resents the fact that some kids miss out on the indoctrination mill that she probably has to wear depends to prevent embarrassment when &quot;private school&quot; is mentioned. Five: Let just say you fell for her line of crap and decided to forgo your private school for public school. And let say you you become active...  is that going to matter? You become only one voice out of many. This article itself generated 2148 comments as I wrote this.  On the flip side, do you want the people with money dictating how your school is run? You, after all, decide to forgo the successful business person for a &quot;community activist&quot; who never worked a real job in his life (he does give good speeches, though). And six: The culture of public schools is deplorable. Lowest common denominator stuff. This is nothing to dismiss flippantly. Each parent owes their child their best effort. Although a private school is not immune to drugs or premarital sex, it is certainly way down from a public school. 100% pof the parents are concerned with the quality of their education, with discipline. That last word is abhorrent to the Allison's out there. By the way, I went both to public school and a public University. I truly hated high-school, mostly because I was surrounded by idiots. I often preformed way beyond my ability just to &quot;fit in&quot;. Peer pressure was unreal. And that was the 70's. Yet I spent the next decade going to college part-time until i earned my degree, so once I escaped that prison, I could actually focus on learning. And this was in a backward, conservative small town. Just reading her opinion gave me an attack of Tourette's syndrom!
