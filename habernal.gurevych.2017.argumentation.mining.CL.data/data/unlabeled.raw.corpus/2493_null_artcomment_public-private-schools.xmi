Unfortunately, Benedikt is forgetting reality here.  More parents getting involved in changing the &quot;crappy public school&quot; because they are invested in it, doesn't mean it will change for the better for all.  Private schools exist for many more reasons other than prestige.  Freedom of choice and sending your child to a school that fits with your guidelines for an education is probably top on the list.   And, parents guidelines differ vastly as well as time to commit to changing a school to meet them.  I went to public school and so did my wife.  Our kids go to public school because we have good public schools.  And although they are good, they still need improvements or changes.  To get these, our parents have to first agree on what those changes need to be, then present to the principal, then School board, which has to answer to the district then state.  After all of that, the politicians get involved as does the Teacher's union which will influence the politicians so that the union and the teachers will benefit. Although I firmly believe public schools better prepare our kids socially, there are public schools in this country that just aren't safe or just don't meet a parents expectations for an education.  More parents invested,  doesn't equal change and if it does, it still would take years to do so.  If Benedikt is saying sending your child to private school makes you a bad person, then I think she needs to study the public school system bureaucracy more.
