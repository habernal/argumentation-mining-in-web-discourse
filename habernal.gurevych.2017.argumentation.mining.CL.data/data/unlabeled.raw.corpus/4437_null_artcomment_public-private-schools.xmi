Her teacher was on a job share, she works 2 days and a relief teacher fills in the other 3. The relief teacher moved on, and for months the relief teachers would rotate, sometimes the same one, other times, a different one. We complained, the answer - our 2 day a week teacher had been in the system for 20 years and was afforded a flexible work environment. I am sure there are many many wonderful teachers in the public system - but I also suspect there is some seriously poor teachers who would not survive in the private system owing to the accountability to parents (not existent in the public system). Not too sure how this changes under the Gonski reforms. We need to make our teachers (and parents for that matter) more accountable. &#10;try being a teacher before you attack them for not being accountable - today teachers are given too many forms to fill out, boxes to tick, while spending 80% of their time dealing with nightmare disruptive problem personality disorder children - often because their problem parents refuse to do anything - just hand them off to us and expect us to fix them - then people complain that we don't have perfect lesson plans (which by the way would take 6-10 hours to prepare - per hour of class - time we don't have) &#10;so yeah - typical parents blame teachers for failures for which they themselves are to blame - and should be held accountable for. &#10;Privat, you've perfectly articulated the reason parents send their kids to private schools. In a nutshell, it's to avoid the kids of bogans who couldn't give a rats about education that drag everyone around them down to their level. If you can avoid your kids being influenced by that type you do it.
