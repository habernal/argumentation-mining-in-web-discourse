Everytime anyone I hear talking about prayer speaks, they state that they should be allowed to hold prayers over intercom and lead class worship. I personally believe this would lead to fights between Christians and less peaceful Wiccans than me, among other religions. How would you feel if a Wiccan ritual was held in honor of our God(s) and your kids were forced to listen to it. How would you feel if one day, your child came home and complained about the school allowing what is deemed witchcraft in most eyes? It would upset most parents, especially the truly religious ones. I might not be someone who has been around for thrity or fourty years but in less than two decades I have studied 4 major religions and 13 minor ones. I have studied my history books and have learned well from them that no matter where one goes there will always be religious persecution following. I completely agree with you about the respect. I will argue all day long about my beliefs of the Bible if I am asked about something. I will straight out say to a Christian that I believe the Bible is a good book but that it is based off half truths filtered down by monarchs and religious leaders. It is full of stories that show the wonders of God. The problem is that there are things that God has brought upon this Earth, and my God has too, that might not have been as deserved as it seems. But I will not just randomly say that the Bible is false and I do not believe it is false. As a proud Wiccan I say that the Bible is true, whether it is the Whole truth is to be decided by (s)he that reads it. Like you said, diversity is good, but don't straight out allow prayer over the student mass. I'm glad someone else agrees in respect between religions.
