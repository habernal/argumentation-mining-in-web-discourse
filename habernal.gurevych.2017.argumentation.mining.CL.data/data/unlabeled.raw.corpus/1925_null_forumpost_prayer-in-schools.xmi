I don't think that I will be getting up in front of the class and saying, &quot;And on the third day, God created p-orbitals and s-orbitals and all manner of forms in which an electron may creepeth around a nucleus. And He saw that it was good&quot;. I do, however, have a biochem prof who has an annoying habit of using the term &quot;evolution&quot; (or variants thereof) at least eighteen times in a class period. It's never relevant to the topic at hand. I think he's just trying to see how many times he can make that point. Really. I'm starting to keep a count. &#10;My university does not have a choir. As for the schools to which you refer, I am reasonably sure that if those students ever made a case of it they could win. Just as I am sure that a case can be made for the freedom to carry a Bible to school with you. Ideally, it would work both ways. &#10;Don't get me started on the pledge. I have problems with it for other reasons. Stopped saying it in high school. &#10;Spoken like a true opponent thereof. Again presuming so much. I don't want kids to be pressured into making some tacit acknowledgement of religion. I am not so stupid as to think that that in any way would change anyone's mind about God. I think it is lazy of the Right to spend so much time on this and so little time actually going out into the world and evangelizing face-to-face. I'm actually against these kinds of things because I think that it furthers a culture of lukewarm pseudo-Christian pretenders and I find that culture far more dangerous to Christianity than any other religion or lack thereof. &#10;Oh, and I've never liked it when people refer to the Bible as mythology. I would ask you to stop...but I doubt you will. &#10;Oh, but it is. You see, as a teacher, I would have several injunctions placed against me concerning my personal actualization of my faith. I think this is wrong. I can't just stop being Christian when I walk in the door because I am an employee of the state. I'm not going to stand out in the hall passing out leaflets, but I sure as heck don't want to get called out for having a Bible on my desk, praying between classes, or even letting on to anyone that I am a Christian. I think it is an intrusion on teachers' rights. &#10;Again, I object to the term &quot;mythology&quot;...not that you care. Actually, I am paying rapt attention. It is something that hits very close to home for me. &#10;And they can feel proud of themselves in the losing end of a lawsuit. Personally, I find the fact that you think this is at all about the worship of an old book silly.
