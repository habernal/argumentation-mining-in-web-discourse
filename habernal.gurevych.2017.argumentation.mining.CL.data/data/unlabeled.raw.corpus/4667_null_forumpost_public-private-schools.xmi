The sayings true, &quot;you only get what you pay for&quot;, it's ok for us as we only have 1 child but what I will say is look at the school, have a taster day (many schools offer this), just because it's private doesn't automatically mean it will suit your child, the amounts of homework my daughter gets in yr 6 are more than I ever got at senior school! &#10;Would I send my dd if it meant I had to live on a shoe string? Before experiencing it I would of probably said no but now? I'd sell the clothes off my back if I had to! &#10;Don't listen to any negative comments, they are usually made by people who have never had first hand experience, go with your gut instincts. &#10;Good luck!"/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2205" language="en" documentId="4667" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="sarah w(1416)" date="31-01-12 23:48" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://www.netmums.com/coffeehouse/children-parenting-190/primary-school-age-4-11-years-60/713563-opinions-private-vs-state-schools-please-all.html" topic="public-private-schools" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="4667" notes="" title="opinions on private vs state schools please"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="183"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="184" end="429"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="430" end="707"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="708" end="984"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="985" end="1306"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="1307" end="1486"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="63" sofa="1" begin="1487" end="1882"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="1883" end="2052"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="71" sofa="1" begin="2053" end="2194"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="75" sofa="1" begin="2195" end="2205"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59 63 67 71 75"/></xmi:XMI>
