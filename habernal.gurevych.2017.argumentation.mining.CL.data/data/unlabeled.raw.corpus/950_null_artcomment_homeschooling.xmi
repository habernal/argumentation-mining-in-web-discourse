There is a good, practical reason why this isn't being changed. The government don't want to open themselves to being sued by the thousands of children leaving school every year without having received what the government itself considers an acceptable level of education. Some of them aren't even literate! &#10;Local Authorities already have the power to investigate and intervene, right up to forcing children into school, IF they suspect that a suitable education is not taking place. What more power do they need? &#10;&quot;If you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear&quot;? So the 'outdated' concepts of privacy, and presumption of innocence mean nothing to you? A statist to the core! &#10;The state (what you really mean when you say 'society') doesn't give a fig for the rights of children otherwise there would be no compulsion in education to begin with. What about the rights of all those children, teenagers in particular, who don't WANT to go to school, and I mean really, really seriously don't want to be there? Those children have no rights because they don't suit the state. As a general rule, and this is recognised by things like the UNCRC, it is parents who have the greatest interest in the health, wellbeing and education of their children. It's one of those natural features of being a parent. Nobody has more interest and investment in a child than their parents. Yes, there are exception, there are bad parents, and there are existing laws to deal with them. Criminalising the rest of us is authoritarian BS!
