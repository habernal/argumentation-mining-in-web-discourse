Isn't the self-interest there just a teeny bit obvious? Some professional builders will no doubt tell you that unqualified people shouldn't be allowed to do a spot of DIY for exactly the same reasons. &#10;You are wrong if you think that these recommendations don't put everyone under suspicion, that's precisely what they do. Currently the law allows Local Authorities to investigate and take action, both on welfare and educational grounds IF they have reason to suspect that there is a problem. We're not talking about an all or nothing situation here, the current rules are more than adequate. This new Orwellian plan puts everyone under suspicion. It says that we must all prove that we are innocent, that we are good parents and we must do so again and again. How is this sane, how is this reasonable and how is this a sensible use of public money? As for the needs and wishes of children, do we see the government asking those who are sent to school what they need or want? Are we heck! If they dare express their wishes by truanting their parents can be fined and jailed! &#10;kikichan is right, this is all about control and nationalising our children.&#10;HJHJ, I wouldn't be at all surprised if they plan just such interventions for everyone else. Home educators are a minority and because we have previously got on with our lives not bothering anyone we are little understood by the wider population and apparently an easy target. Once the precedent has been set with us of course it'll be on to those stay at home mums with their under 5s. OFSTED are of the opinion that we all need to be CRB checked and again such madness is unlikely to stop with home educators. &#10;Lambage, NO I don't think you have a right to know what my child is learning. If she chooses medicine as a career and qualifies as a doctor then you can be pretty confident that she will have the skills and knowledge necessary for that job. You don't need to know what periods of British history she studied, what books she read. It won't effect you if she read any Shakespeare or not. It really is none of your business and none of the state's business. &#10;As for the tired old socialisation question. I'm late commenting on this article because I was out with my 6 year old and a dozen other families (children from babes-in-arms up to teenagers) visiting industrial ruins, photographing frogs and being introduced to an alpaca called Odin.
