My family all went through the public school system; the private option was a Catholic School that was smaller and therefore could not offer as broad a range of academic classes.  The private school students had similar socioeconomic backgrounds to the students at the public school.  Unless your family had a desire for a Catholic school environment (more time on religion and less emphasis on academics) everyone went to the public school (one high school for the entire town), the private school did not offer better academics and other than the religious eduation part the environments were very similar.  The very involved parents mentioned in the article supported the public school system in this small Midwest town (only the extremely wealthy sometimes sent students out of state to private schools) and the education you received there was good for the high achievers interested in higher education opportunities as well as for those seeking a high school or vocational education.  My parents were very supportive of education.  My older brother received a scholarship to go to MIT, I received a scholarship to go to Harvard, my younger brother received a scholarship to go Stanford.  We all went on to obtain advanced professional degrees.  My brothers and I may have started college with a slightly less advanced academic background than our college classmates that went to elite private schools like  Exeter, Andover, etc. but we and our fellow public school graduates quickly caught and more often than not surpassed the private school graduates by the end of the first semester. I think the public school graduates in general also felt less entitled, worked harder, and had a better understanding of life in America for all socioeconomic groups. If all public schools were like the one in this small Midwest town, there would be no need for private schools for parents that desire excellent educational opportunities for their children.  In larger cities there are often private schools that the rich can afford that offer better academic educations (but less opportunity to better understand the diversity seen in public schools).  If there were no private schools, would the supportive parents (and their children) have changed the public school environment so ALL had the opportunity for a better education in a more academic environment?   The ideal situation would be for everyone to have the same educational opportunities to achieve their academic goals but also to receive the &quot;life&quot; education that  goes with interacting with all socioeconomic groups.  I believe in the value of a public school academic and life education; all my children and my nephews and nieces went to public schools and went on to attend prestigious colleges.  One of my sibs was upset by the &quot;priorities&quot; of the local school system and went so far as to run for and win a seat on the school board.   In the ideal world there would be no reason not to consider sending your children to public schools. I'm concerned that some of the posters reasons for wanting private schools is to avoid other races and socioeconomic classes.  Normally someone saying they are not racist means they really are racist or elitist and don't realize it.  I think the point of the article is that the involved parents can avoid the difficulty of providing a good education for ALL children by enrolling their children in private schools and ignoring the fate of the public schools; in doing so they remove the positive influences they and their children would have.  It is human nature to want what is best for your children;  it is a better human nature to want what is best for every child.  Every child deserves a good opportunity to accomplish their goals.
