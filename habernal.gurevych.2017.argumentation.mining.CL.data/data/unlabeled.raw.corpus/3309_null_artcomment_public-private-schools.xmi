Where did she acquire the authority to decide that &quot;bad&quot; people send their kids to private school? She and others who go around calling others &quot;bad people&quot; because they hold differing opinions are the real &quot;bad people&quot;. They are one of the main reasons for the slow but steady corruption of our original ideals of liberty and free speech. She could have simply made her point about improving the public schools by sending our kids there and getting involved in the system, but that isn't what she's after. She's using the Liberal tactic of vilifying the opposition in order to discourage others from adopting that position. There's nothing 'bad' about sending one's children to private school. It at least ensures that a few kids will come to adulthood knowing the difference between 'its' and 'it's', 'your' and you're'. Besides which, her point is pretty lame. What percentage of the American people send their kids to  private schools these days? I don't know the figure, but it's bound to be fairly small. So, she is suggesting that this influx of a few parents into the big world of public schools is going to produce a dramatic change in our public schools? Who suggested that she write that article - Mr. Obama, perhaps? Again, I don't know, but I suspect that he'd love to see all children in government-run schools. Get 'em while they're young!
