I figured, “of course he is ready!” Fast foward to now–because so many parents in our district decided to reshirt their children, there was a 15 month age discrpency in his class and he was one of three youngest. In fact, HALF of the class would be 6 by the end of December, with my son not turning 6 until the following fall! After he exhibted signs of stress and anxiety from being in this class, mostly around social issues (academically, he was fine and even above some of the kids) we decided to pull him until next year. Now, i undrestand that someone has to be the youngest and I was fully prepared for it to be my son, but he was put in an environment where he could not be successful. He acts like a typical 5 year old boy and was in a class with a lot of kids who acted like typical 6 year olds. He said they wouldn’t let him play and were mean to him. He had anxiety about school and never wanted to go. So personally, I think reshirting really makes a really unfair advantage to the kids who go on time. Now I am stuck with an upset little boy and a year more of private school so that he can fit in. Ridiculous.
