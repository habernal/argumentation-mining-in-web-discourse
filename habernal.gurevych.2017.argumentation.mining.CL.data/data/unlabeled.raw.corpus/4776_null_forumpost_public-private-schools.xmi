What do you mean by all kids today are indocrtinated into BS statism? Seriously clarify that indoctrination, and what would be better. We do have an education problem, but I don't think you have identified it correctly. &#10;To address the concern about private schooling and home schooling, I am in favor of both, on the condition the majority of students attend public schools. Two of my grandchildren are in alternative schools, and one was homeschooled for awhile. One was in a Japanese school for a couple of years. Where I live there are plenty of choices. I do not understand the discussion of lack of choice. But for facts, try these.... &#10;No country has 100% literacy and although the US is not the top country it has over 97% literacy today, and never in history has the literacy rate been so high. &#10;Any statement that in the 1770 literacy was higher, would refer to the literacy of educated people, not the masses who were mostly illiterate. Until after WWII it was common to drop out of school in the 8th grade and go to work. The literacracy in 1770 would mean literate in Greek and Roman classics and the philsophies and sciences developing in there time, and yes educated people would be literate in these things they are today. Compare to them, most of us are seriously illiterate, and this is a problem for democracy. &#10;You should also be aware of what the GI bill did to our economy by sending a flood of college educated GI's into the work place. This was followed by the National Defense Education and college grants for just about anyone, excellerating our technological society so much, people are afraid to be without college education. We have so many college people today, the qualifications for jobs are shy high. This is a huge difference from when I entered the work force. Today people are much more specialized than they were.
