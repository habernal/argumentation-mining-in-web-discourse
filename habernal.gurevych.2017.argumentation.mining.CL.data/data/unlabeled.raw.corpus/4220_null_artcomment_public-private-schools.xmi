Meaning in my city I have witnessed a 3rd grade teacher speaking to kids in spanish while the english speaking kids just sit there. I dropped a class in college because majority of the class was hispanic so the teacher decided she was going to rush through the parts in english and take longer talking to them in spanish and them one day the class was being taught in spanish. Sorry we all need to be on the same page. My brother was in a 5th grade class failing it. My dad went to a conference and noticed all the things in the class were in spanish. When he asked the teacher why he said because majority of my kids speak spanish I cant afford majority of my class to fail.   Also I notice that allot of the people who send their kids to public schools don't get involved they don't want to. They just want the school to feed their child, educate their child, and be able to drop them off very early for free breakfast, followed by a free lunch and free afternoon snack. All while the other kids have to pay. Sorry I would not want my kids to see that other cultures are being more catered to, while I struggle to get her what she needs. If a private school will treat all of the equal and not catering to certain cultures that seem to think America owes them. Then Yes I am not rich but I will try my hardest to send my child to a private school.
