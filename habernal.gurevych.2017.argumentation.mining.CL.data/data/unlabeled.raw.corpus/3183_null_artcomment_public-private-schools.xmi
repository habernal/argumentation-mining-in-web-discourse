Ever since the school administrators decided that it was not legally conducive to employ corporal punishment in the schools....ever since the psychologists decided that it is harmful to the child's mental well being.  There is a problem in the Public schools that will not ever be addressed with statistics of the past.  When I was in school as a youngster......The principle of the school had a &quot;board of education&quot; hanging above his desk......if your infractions of the rules warranted it.....you got a spanking!  Not a beating......A SPANKING!  And your parents were called and told about the incident.  The rules in our house was.....if you were in trouble at school.....you got it again when you got home!  In the same breath....if you had troubles with bullying by other students or by the teacher.....that too was handled by the principle!  If anybody reads the Bible......it even states in the Bible &quot;spare the rod and spoil the child&quot;  Meaning that if you don't use corporal punishment the child will feel above the rules and above the laws!  I agree that there are fine lines here.....but enough of this &quot;poor Johnny or poor Jennie&quot; stuff.  Education Begins at HOME and continues through the system!  But I'm all for private or home schooling our children.  Also all of this Politically Correct education is galling me!  I don't want my children to think that they cannot believe the religious and moral teachings that come with our family traditions!  Now the schools are teaching that the alternative lifestyles are acceptable?  No......my children will learn that there are consequences for living immorally and illegally!  The United States has gone crazy and THIS is why there is so much violence happening in the U.S.  Not because we are not giving enough to our own children.  Even the politicians teach our children that if they lie and do wrong they will get ahead in life....by their own standards!
