Right before graduation she was accepted to a great University she goes part time because that's all we can afford. Believe it or not she is now wants to be a teacher. I think she will be great of course I am her mother. It just depends of where you live and if the district is good or bad. That's my opinion. She learned a lot in the private school how to  pace yourself when learning a new subject thus learning it, so I don't think private schools are bad for kids and it doesn't make them think they are better than everyone else their like all the other kids  in college.
