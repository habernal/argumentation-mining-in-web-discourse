I have always argued there is no magic age. I started K at 4 cut off was Dec 1st I was born Oct 31st. I was always the shortest but I was so small for my age I would have been the shortest if I waited a year. I did well in school and graduated at 17 ready for college, My brother was born Dec 8th. Cut off was still Dec 1st. He was held back in K because he was not mature enough. Ohh and so now he was almost 2 years older and still the smallest one in size. &#10;I had one child that had serious social delays but was academically advanced. I wanted to hold out an extra year for another year of preschool. I was told I could keep her out of school but the next year she would be automatically placed in first grade. I thought if she was not ready for 1/2 day K how would she be ready a year later for full day 1st grade? We put her in Kindergarten at 5. She floored us. She learned the lacking social skills. She is now in 6th grade in all honors classes and doing really well. &#10;Her younger sister started K this year and I worried about her short attention span and volume level. She has no problems with them now. &#10;@Bev some kids really do have good attention spans my eldest daughter now a high schooler would watch ants for hours on end at 3. I kept asking what is up with this child aren’t kids supposed to have short attention spans. I guess she never got that memo.
