Why? firstly I know that both state and public schools receive their teachers from the same universities. Second, I would like to have some money left over for travel, retirement. Third, for both mathematics and English she will have a tutor. Fourth, how a child behaves and the people they choose to hang around with, good or bad, is dependent upon their personality and the confidence and values you have taught them at home. Both private and state schools have people no parent would want their child hanging around with,. &#10;Discipline starts at home.&#10;Not often I reply with so few words, but I agree with you whole heartedly. Financial stress is a big negative on a family, having money in hand to spend at your discretion (address a specific weakness(es) or develop a talent(s)), time to spend with children including travel is extremely beneficial. And most importantly, your comment: &#10;&quot;how a child behaves and the people they choose to hang around with, good or bad, is dependent upon their personality and the confidence and values you have taught them at home. Both private and state schools have people no parent would want their child hanging around with&quot;. &#10;Very well said.&#10;There is no substitue for parental involvement - its all about time and effort. You can't outsource that. &#10;Fully agree with MG and Mike. That's the balance we have as well and it is working for us. We could both earn more, but we chose public schooling so we have the time to parent and participate in our kid's lives, and also have the money to enrich their experiences and enjoy our lives. As my kid's say, YOLO!
