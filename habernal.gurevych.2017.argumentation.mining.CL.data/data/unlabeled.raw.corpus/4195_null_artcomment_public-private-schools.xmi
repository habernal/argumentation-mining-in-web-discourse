I don't blame the teachers in public school, they have no control over how many kids are put in their classes. Some public don't even have books. The teachers or their helpers make copies of the pages needed for the students to do their work. Prep school, everyone has the books they need, many of the books are on line, they all have to have lap tops, and smart phones are a must. The private school or at least the private school here in my area is ten times more technical. The public schools are very very behind. With all that being said my 15 year old went to prep school his freshman year and hated and is back in public school. It was his choice to go to private school and it was his choice to go back to public.  He was so unhappy, he is a very smart kid but he is a total redneck and did not fit in. He has however learned that money does NOT make you better then someone else and that was a big lesson he learn at private school. He learned that the kids had no respect for the things they had or their hard working parents. He has to work and earn his keep and pay for the extras that he wants as we as his parents say NO more often then not.
