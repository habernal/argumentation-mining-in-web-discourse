Quite frankly private schools should receive minimal, preferably no, funding from the government - that's why they're called &quot;Private Schools&quot; and if you can't send your kids to a private school without government assistance, then you probably can't afford to give them a private education. Taxes should be spent where they're most needed such as the aged pension, roads, public transport, not supporting the middle and upper classes. Middle class welfare is destroying this country. &#10;I'm so sick of this misplaced argument. Every child is entitled to the same level of government funding. If I choose to pay more to send my kids to private school that's my choice. I pay an enormous amount of tax, a lot of which is used to fund a third rate, union run public education system. If we want better and more egalitarian outcomes then all education should be privatised. BTW the only reason there's a higher % of kids in private education in Aust is because the union run public system is so crap. Giving more funding to public education is a waste of my taxes. &#10;@perspective - No it isn't a misplaced argument! Private school is a choice as you say, not a right. &#10;However i agree with the union arguments, and IMO the public school system are lacking a process of teacher assessments (i.e. test like students). Without a process of performance review, the teachers are taking their position for granted. &#10;Lastly i fully disagree with privatizing education, education is NOT a business. Do you want a philosophy that money is above all else? I can tell you Business is about bottom line and in the value of exchange in that bottom line is money. I don't mind Businesses talking about money because that's exactly what they need to thrive and survive on, but should education be the same philosophy and directions? I hope not!
