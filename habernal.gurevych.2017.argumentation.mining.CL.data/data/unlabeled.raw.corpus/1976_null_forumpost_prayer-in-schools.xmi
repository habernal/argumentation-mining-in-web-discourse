However, to interfere with an individual student's free exercise of religion is also unconstitutional. &#10;No offense taken.&#10;This is clearly an unconstitutional interference with the free exercise of religion. Students are allowed to bring religious texts to school, read such texts in between classes, pray, belong to extracurricular religious clubs, etc. &#10;In 1995, the President of the United States ordered the Secretary of Education to give guidance to public schools on the religious rights of students. Two things are particularly noteworthy: &#10;&quot;First, schools may not forbid students acting on their own from expressing their personal religious views or beliefs solely because they are of a religious nature. Schools may not discriminate against private religious expression by students, but must instead give students the same right to engage in religious activity and discussion as they have to engage in other comparable activity. Generally, this means that students may pray in a nondisruptive manner during the school day when they are not engaged in school activities and instruction, subject to the same rules of order that apply to other student speech. &#10;At the same time, schools may not endorse religious activity or doctrine, nor may they coerce participation in religious activity. Among other things, of course, school administrators and teachers may not organize or encourage prayer exercises in the classroom. Teachers, coaches and other school officials who act as advisors to student groups must remain mindful that they cannot engage in or lead the religious activities of students.&quot; &#10;It is further noted that &quot;Public schools can neither foster religion nor preclude it. Our public schools must treat religion with fairness and respect and vigorously protect religious expression as well as the freedom of conscience of all other students. In so doing our public schools reaffirm the First Amendment and enrich the lives of their students.&quot; &#10;Even the vile and contemptuous Americans for the Separation of Church and State acknowledged: &quot;Nothing in the 1962 or 1963 rulings makes it unlawful for public school students to pray or read the Bible (or any other religious book) on a voluntary basis during their free time. Later decisions have made this even clearer. In 1990, the high court ruled specifically that high school students may form clubs that meet during &quot;non-instructional&quot; time to pray, read religious texts or discuss religious topics if other student groups are allowed to meet.&quot; &#10;No, it's an attempt to prohibit the free exercise of religion, which is unconstitutional.&#10;No, it's an attempt to prohibit the free exercise of religion, which is unconstitutional.&#10;Yes.&#10;The free exercise of religion is absolute and the government has no right whatsoever to interfere with it in any way.
