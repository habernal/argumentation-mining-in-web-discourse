I believe the writer is off, but I also appreciate free speech and everyone is entitled to their opinion.  There are some 1800+ comments, so my apologies if I am repeating sentiment already stated.  I couldn’t help but mess with the writer “someone”, so I just replied to his/her comment on this thread (check out my note there!). I actually like some of statements of this writer (although I disagree with most).  I would like to state that in a “Perfect World”, this crazy scheme might work!  But we don’t live in a perfect world and many twist the system (pick your system) to their benefit rather than for “Greater Good”.  Where are the George Washington's and Thomas Jefferson's of the world?   I have one child in public school and another in private.  Both would currently be in private school, but we interviewed the prospective teachers (both public and private) and felt public school was the better choice at this point in time.  Ultimately I would love to see both of my boys in a Charter School, but the one in our neighborhood has a massive wait list. The Public school system is broken and I love the concept of Charter Schools.  You can’t fix the school system when the management / fiscal functions are broken and many teachers have lost faith in the system. You can also apply this to Healthcare, Social Security, Government and a laundry list of other systems. Whether my children go to Public, Private or Charter, their education will be augmented at home (one of the comments the writer alludes to).  We read with our kids.  We challenge them mentally.  And we take them on trips to experience different places, customs and cultures.   There is no perfect answer, but I do believe in education (formal and informal).  I often ponder and interesting quote: “Education Opens a Closed Mind” (author unknown).  And I have met some ignorant / uneducated (not stupid) people in my life!  And I am not putting down people without degrees.  My father never completed his high school degree, but he was well read, well travelled and very articulate.   The writer is correct that there needs to be more involvement, but everyone needs to pick the battle(s) that is most important to them.  I’m tackling education from a micro (my community) perspective and hope everyone does the same thing since a ton of micro effort will turn into a macro effort.   I’ve enjoyed the post and the intellectual banter that ensured.  I’d like to end with a comment that I say to many of my family and friends on any topic that has two sides.  “I agree to disagree”… "/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2645" language="en" documentId="2644" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Carl_1963" date="Aug 29, 2013 8:34PM" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://living.msn.com/family-parenting/the-family-room-blog-post?post=ab228ffc-1e99-4b37-a7b8-0b6a4c3fb240" topic="public-private-schools" thumbsUp="2" thumbsDown="0" origId="2644" notes="" title="Is it wrong to send kids to private school?"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2645"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39"/></xmi:XMI>
