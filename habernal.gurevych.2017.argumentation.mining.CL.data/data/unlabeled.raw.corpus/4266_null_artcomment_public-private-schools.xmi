I came from a blue-collar family and environment and the education and experience paid off. I have owned and sold several businesses and I now am semi-retired in the west.   The wealthier boys(it was an all male school when I attended, it changed to co-ed the year after I graduated) had the same home life as I did. Parents concerned about thier progress and if their spending that much money was making a difference. However, there was a few boys who only had a glimpse of family life at school because their parents were jet-setters and they rarely saw them. One had a limousine and a Lear jet at his disposal everyday at the age of 16.   I disagree with your point that these parents should send their children to public school. The private education environment is not for everyone. We competed at a level that in some respects is equal to the top 5% of the students in public school but what usually was lacking were the negative social distractions.   My father couldn't afford to send me, so I went on an academic and athletic scholarship. I was suppose to go to a public school but it was closed opening day because of a riot. Next thing I know my parents have me at this boarding school. I thank them and God everyday that they had that second option for me.   A better solution is to give businesses a tax incentive to invest in their local public school system because that is most likely where their workforce will come from. Investing in their future employees with a higher level of competency is good for the student, their parents and the community.
