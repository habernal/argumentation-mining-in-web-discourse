We live in an August 1st cut-off state and her birthday is in late July. She went to private K at age 5 and then repeated K at the public school at age 6. &#10;I think you really have to consider emotional, academic and social development when making the decision. For DD, she was behind in all three areas. &#10;My concerns really had very little to do with Kindergarten. K has fairly low expectations where I live and it is not required. However I felt she would struggle severely in 1st grade after the year of private K. She simply was not ready. My opinion is that the increased pressure of standardized testing is trickling down to the curriculum of the lower grades. I wonder if anyone has looked at red-shirting rates in relation to No-Child-Left-Behind? &#10;Our principal is clear that he will not retain until 2nd grade (it's no coincidence that standardized testing begins in 3rd). So I knew I would be sending DD to struggle for several years before she was likely to be retained. Or she would be one of these borderline kids who struggles enough to become frustrated and discouraged, but not enough to get any help from the school. &#10;Ultimately I feel that I am responsible for my children's education, not the school system. So this was a decision I made to give her the best chance at learning and being successful. I am always surprised that other people care so much. I have never encountered anyone IRL that has questioned our decision.
