Let me enlighten you as I have the benefit of having a wife who is an elementary school teacher. First and foremost, the public school system in Texas is about as broken as can be. The Federal Government offers money to local school districts for each student in attendance and even more money for schools who meet the Federal testing standards. The state then takes that money and doles it out according to their own state testing standards. The local school system then administers it's own bench marks every six weeks. Add to that, disricts want to base teacher salaries on test scores. Teachers have no choice or time but to teach the tests  With all the testing that goes on when is there time to teach? Children no longer get to have recess due to the time constraints of the day so nervous energy goes into the classroom causing discipline problems. If teachers send discipline problems to the principal they are branded poor classroom managers and &quot;written up&quot;. If teachers attempt to correct discipline problems they are chastised by the parents. Who wants to be a teacher? Creativity and autonomy have been replaced with scripted programs and no support outside the classroom. Thanks to the little known advent of &quot;Inclusion&quot;, low performing, special needs and mentally and or physically handicapped children are mainstreamed into the regular classroom. These children leave the classroom for their &quot;special&quot; programs for about an hour out of the day. As such, teachers must maintain several curriculums and teach at the highest level of the lowest child. I hope you don't have exceptional children in your household. They will be bored and get into trouble. Gone are the days when students were segregated by ability and teachers could teach at the highest level of the highest child. These are just a few of the problems with the school system. Superintendents are paid exorbitant salaries and are now business majors. Yeah, we care about your kids. More like, we care how well they score on the tests. After knowing all this, I would rather starve and work several jobs to send my kids to a school I know will give them the caliber of education I got or better. Don't worry though, with all the people in Texas sending their kids to private school, we still pay school taxes and the local school district still can't seem to match the private school education.
