NYC public schools have a cutoff of Dec 31. So, half of the kindergartners are 4. It used to be ALL kids started KG at 4 years and years ago but NYC isn't going to change theirs because of all the lower income children that they want to ensure are in public school, the earlier the better. They even have Universal Pre-K, so that's the system there. NY state other than NYC is Dec 1st cutoff, and Connecticut is also December 31 I believe. The funny thing is that these late cutoffs aren't associated with lower test scores. Hmmm......I guess it doesn't matter THAT much. &#10;Again, if you had 4 year olds in kindergarten, you'd be used to it and you wouldn't think it was wrong or weird. &#10;My argument: I don't care where the cutoffs are. Redshirting has absolutely NOTHING to do with the &quot;age&quot; itself and everything to do with your Snowflake in relation to everyone else in the class. TRUST ME, there is redshirting no matter where the cutoffs are. People redshirt in my District. They redshirt Oct and Nov kids. NO ONE in the entire County would sit there and argue that a Summer boy wasn't ready to start kindergarten. They'd think that was absurd, of course they are ready. Because that is the reality here, with December cutoffs. But if your cutoffs were July, yep, you'd have people redshirting their May and June kids so as not to be the youngest. &#10;Eventually this trend will stop and everyone will be remarking 20 years from now how silly this shit was.
