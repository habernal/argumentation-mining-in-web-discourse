So I'll just list my own reasons for preferring single-sex, for MYSELF, and if any of them apply to you/your daughter I guess that's cool. This is partly a reaction to the many pro-co-ed posts in this thread, and maybe (if you are leaning towards all-girls for academic reasons) to reassure you that we aren't all totally socially awkward :) &#10;In primary school (co-ed) I was extremely shy, and a lot of that was to do with boys – not so much directly impressing them as I was always the type to have crushes from afar, but I often preferred activities where I knew there wouldn't be boys (so I wouldn't feel so self-conscious). And I never spoke up in class or volunteered information for fear of looking foolish. &#10;People say single-sex (this may be a private/public divide as well) schools are insulating, and while I agree that this can be true I think sometimes a little insulation can be useful. Certainly I became much more self-confident in a world where boys weren't even an issue. I don't believe for a second that going to a single-sex school means you can't talk to the opposite sex. I do engineering now, and have more male friends than female, and I don't have the slightest issue talking to any of them, nor do I see them as exotic and special as some seem to think. But I do think having a period where I could just grow up was really good. &#10;Yes life isn't segregated – but high school doesn't have to be a mirror image of life to prepare you for it. &#10;I don't even know if I'd be doing engineering if I'd gone co-ed. I can see the person I was at age 13 not choosing maths/science subjects to avoid the boys. As others mentioned we did have very small maths/hard science classes in senior, but I'm not sure how anyone could say that's a bad thing! In fact I was very strongly influenced by the personal contact with my senior science teachers. &#10;Socially: I dated (not nearly as much as some!) during high school. I hung out with guys socially, I had geeky, interesting, non-bitchy friends (they exist in girls' schools too!), and generally I don't think I have problems talking to guys these days nor do I fall in love with every one I meet. All in all I think I've turned out remarkably normal!
