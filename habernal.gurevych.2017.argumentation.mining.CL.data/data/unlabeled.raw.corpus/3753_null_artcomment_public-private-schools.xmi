MAYBE there is something to the theory that if EVERYONE attended public schools they would be &quot;better&quot;, but then to imply that parents who send their kids to private schools are &quot;bad&quot; is just......way too out there. In theory, maybe this far-fetched plan COULD work, if you give it decades to take effect.  But what good does that do any child NOW? It's just such a terribly simple &quot;solution&quot; to a ridiculously complicated problem with the public school system. How about we focus on paying GOOD teachers the salaries they deserve for the nearly round-the-clock job they do, instead of paying mediocre teachers smaller salaries to fill classrooms. It's so backwards, which is why I ultimately decided not to pursue education. That being said, I was lucky enough to take away very much from my public schooling, and found it to be better than what I received at my private catholic school. I had some very strong teachers, and it seemed that together they developed a great network of support for students and each other. Now, administrators, that's another story.  There are some very good public schools out there, so I don't think anyone should turn their nose up at individual schools just because they aren't private. The private Catholic high school had a rampant drug problem, along with plenty of promiscuity and scandal. It all just depends on where you are. It would obviously be a different case in a large urban area, or underserviced rural areas. My public school was right in the middle of that - middle class, mixed race, class size of around 2,000. I think for that kind of area it worked really well.
