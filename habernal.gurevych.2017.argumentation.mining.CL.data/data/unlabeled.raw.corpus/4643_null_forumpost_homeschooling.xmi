I mean, I had a mortgage and was on my own with DH by junior year of college and never had to depend on either set of our parents for anything after we got married so I think a lot depends on the person. I know plenty of young people today are returning home after college out of necessity, plenty of my own friends are at that stage in life where their oldest children are at that age now and are coming back home. BUT they aren't making it comfortable for them, if you get my drift. They are required to get jobs - if its not the &quot;dream&quot; job, its the local McDonalds, if they can't get that - then they are doing what ever mom and dad need done at home to &quot;pay&quot; their room and board. The &quot;rules&quot; are more relaxed - they are adults after all - but they are pulling their weight or they lose their keys. If they can't contribute monetarily via rent they contribute in other ways to the household bottom line. &#10;By the time I was a junior in college, DH and I owned our home (payed our mortgage), payed our bills, I went to school full time, worked full time, managed our home, he worked full time. I was a freshly minted 21 year old. Plenty of my friends were sharing off campus apartments, working full time, going to school full time, piled into tiny apartments, at capacity just to get off campus. The rest of them were married (it was a big summer for it) and renting apartments and going to school full time, working full time. &#10;I know plenty of young married couples today who struggle and work two jobs and make it work. Or kids who come home after college and need help but pull their weight. But I also know plenty who come home after college and sponge off of mom and dad because they can.
