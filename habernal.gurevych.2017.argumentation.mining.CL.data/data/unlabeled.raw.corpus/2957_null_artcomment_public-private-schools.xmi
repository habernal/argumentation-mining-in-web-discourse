That should be my right as a private citizen. I am not wealthy but we choose to pay for schooling while gladly paying taxes to support the public schools. All but one of our sons have college degrees and the one will graduate this fall. Those degrees include masters and soon to be PhD's. College has been paid for by scholarships and hard work by all of them. Not a single one has gone into debt. Our one foray into the public school system resulted in bullying. We went through the proper channels for months but the principle and teacher refused to intervene. He was being bullied and made fun of primarily for making good grades. It took us telling him to fight the kid to get it to stop. I'm not saying that all public schools in our area would have been the same. We just found a great school in the Catholic system after the bullying incidents and choose to stay with it. I don't like having any one group or individual try to control my right to worship, pray or make decisions on education. This lady has a right to her beliefs but she isn't going to shove them upon me without a fight. This is supposed to be a free country. As far as her opinion of me being a &quot;bad&quot; person, that gave me a good laugh. Does she really think people are going to change their minds because SHE thinks they are BAD? That remark may have bothered me in kindergarten or grammar school but as an adult, I'm not loosing a bit of sleep.
