It is because the public school system is supposedly doing so badly that I am forced to prove my worth through my students' test scores. This is also why, instead of getting more funding so that I can incorporate the types of hands-on exploration I would love to have in my classroom, I'm having to prove that the little bit of funding I do get is being used apporpriately, and things like buying supplies for my classroom (which I do out of my own pocket, for the most part, simply so I don't have to prove anything) don't seem to be appropriate anymore. &#10;It seems to me like a neverending cycle until we get some people actually in power here that care about the public school system enough to commit to fixing it instead of continually pointing out ways that it seems we are failing. We have a government here in our state that is looking for ways to discredit the public school system and is actually pushing the online &quot;K12&quot; system as the way to go for Kansas kids. As a result, our teacher's union is under vicious attack and they are actively trying to take rights away from us teachers, such as collective bargaining. &#10;So, yes, the negative opinion of public schools most definitely affects me and my job, and I'm currently just barely making it on my salary as it is. &#10;Maybe we teachers are jaded, but it sure would be helpful to have the support of our communitites as we fight to give the best education to the kids we have in our classrooms while those with power over our ability to do so try to tear us down. &#10;I understand that no one here has actively spoken out against teachers, but there are most definitely consequences to the people of the community losing faith in the public school system, and most of those consquences fall on the teachers. &#10;Edited to fix typos."/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1940" language="en" documentId="565" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="ason828" date="Last edited 09/05/2013" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://community.babycenter.com/post/a44369503/home_schooling_debate_this_hypothetical?cpg=21" topic="homeschooling" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="565" notes="" title="Home schooling: Debate this hypothetical"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="711"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="712" end="1281"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="1282" end="1432"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="1433" end="1678"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="1679" end="1919"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="1920" end="1940"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59"/></xmi:XMI>
