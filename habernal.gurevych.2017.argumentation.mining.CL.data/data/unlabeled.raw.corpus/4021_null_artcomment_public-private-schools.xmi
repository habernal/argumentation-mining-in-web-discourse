It involved taking the Public School System private. Privatizing the school system would then encompass that the system would run on a grant in aid system that would make those who could afford it to pay for the education and those that could not afford it to get the necessary grants to pay for the education of the children.   I went to a public school system, My children from my first marriage went to a public school system. My third wife however insisted on private schooling because of her desire to teach them religious studies, which in public schools is banned by the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution separating church and state. A bridge to this was implemented state-wide in Wisconsin where vouchers are available to disadvantaged children (up to 500 of them) to attend private grade schools.   Now, where am I going with this you ask? If you privatize all of the schools, you force the decisions back into the hands of the parents, you reset the rules of education and hold the teachers accountable. They get paid an equitable amount based on parent and child feedback and school income. The schools would be non-profits so they wouldn't have a tax burden so all the funding would go to the education of the kids and the payroll of the teachers and facilities maintenance.   Privatizing would also free up as much as One Trillion Dollars in federal monies that is now put towards education and its related structures. Utilization of private schools can also filter out those that use welfare as a crutch, saving money by finding ways to get those people back on the payrolls and on to more honest lives. I will note that this is an ideal thought, because it is easier said than done.   One other note: Some of those that send their children to private schools are NOT rich. I know I'm not. I will admit that I am in better shape than many others out there, but it has not been easy. I have been laid off, twice. I have got up, brushed myself off, and went out and tried again. I had to move from my hometown to where I am now to find work, and the location is in the opposite direction of where I'd rather be, which is in Florida. My wife and I make a decent living, but we are nowhere near rich, which I quantify as making over $200,000 a year take home after taxes, health insurance expenses, and retirement savings, which means the gross income is almost double that.   So, if you want to encourage changes in your schools, privatize them, take ownership, and dictate the curriculum that your children need to learn. Keep in mind, it takes a village to feed and educate a child, and everyone has to pull their weight. If it is not with money, then it is with their time and talents.
