The town I grew up in has a terrible school system even though the taxes we pay to fund them border on being ridiculously high.  Part of the problem with public schools is the fact they have union teachers. Once these teachers have two years under their belts, they cannot be fired for not doing their job (unless the commit a felony). You get teachers who could care less if their students whether their students learn or not.  These children are warehoused and passed along--thanks to the no child left behind ideology.  There is, however another more compelling reason to send your child to private school. My parents sent me to a private Christian (not Catholic) school. Every school day began with both prayer and the pledge of allegiance.If a child misbehaved in school, the school was allowed to punish the student (not necessarily with corporal punishment).   Though we did not wear uniforms in my school, we were to dress in neat, clean clothing (no jeans or t-shirts) and no &quot;gang related apparel such as certain brands of jackets, sneakers, hats or bandanas. We were actually required to meet a very high standard for reading, math, grammar and science. If we failed to meet that standard, we were held back or had to repeat the courses during summer school.  Public schools don't seem to demand any standards. Public schools don't teach children any values---they can't because most values are based in religion. They can't implement  much in the way of disciplinary action unless the student brings a weapon to school.  I work with young people who have been through the public high school in my town.  For the most part, their grammar is abysmal, their spelling atrocious, their knowledge of math and science ridiculous! One senior who recently graduated came to work at my place of employment and  I quoted something from Shakespeare to him and he had no idea who Shakespeare was.  I could cry!   Public schools are very restricted as to what they can teach, if they teach anything at all.  When you pay for education directly, teachers feel the financial sting if parents are unsatisfied with their child's progress once they start pulling their child from that school. No children to teach--no paycheck. To me, that is the most compelling reason to send a child to private school.
