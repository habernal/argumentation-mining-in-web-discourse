The older, more mature boys really do tend to be the leaders, the confident ones, and the morally and academically stronger. &#10;1) I talked with a lot of moms and high school kids who were “redshirted” and not one regretted the decision. BUT, I talked to quite a few who wish that they had been held back to be the oldest rather than the youngest. &#10;2) I think it really depends on your particular school/district trend. I don’t agree with redshirting, but since that is what EVERYONE else is doing, I am not ready to be the mom who uses my kid to make a statement. &#10;3) Size and athletic ability matters perhaps more than academic skill in middle school and high school. (I teach and have taught both levels.) The younger, smaller boys get HAMMERED in middle school. Yes, they will be FINE as the youngest in 1st-5th…. but look at where you think your boy will be at the middle/high levels. I DO NOT think this is a big issue for girls. Girls just mature faster anyways… and think about your junior boy who still can not drive or take his girl out on a date when all of his sophomore friends are already having that power:) &#10;4) I did research testing data on kids who were and were not redshirted- the non-redshirted tend to do BETTER on state test scores in high school…. probably less boredom, or forced to rise to the top to make up for youth? But, the difference was not enough to deter me from choosing my son to be 6 when he starts Kindy. &#10;5) I STRUGGLED with decision…. and because of that, I figured that I’d rather err on the side of giving him one more year to really be ready rather than push him through.
