Let's compare it to the high schooling of someone in Anacostia (and remember in Anacostia they are paying $29K per student for that terrible experience). &#10;Parents homeschool for religious reasons it's true. But many parents homeschool because like the District the SAT average score is 810 at their local high school---that is score for BOTH parts of the SAT..... &#10;As for a parent being able to teach from K-12....usually parents find other parents who homeschool. My son, who has a BS in both Math and Physics was taught high school English by a parent with a MA in English Lit---she also was a published author. He was taught biology from an actual biologist. He was taught math by an engineer. Physics by a physicist. We lived in several different places and by word of mouth found these parents. At first I was worried because he was only doing three hours of school work a day---but it turned out to be very intensive when you don't have 15 other people vying for a instructors attention. So he studied things he would not have gotten in most high schools--anatomy, Chinese, medieval English literature; he acted in plays, learned an instrument (learned two actually), sang in a choir, wrote music, wrote apps, studied astronomy, wrote an app for others to study astronomy...you get the picture, I think. How would he be in public school--don't know and didn't have to find out. &#10;Homeschooling is so much more now then when we started 17 years ago; it really represents parents and children pursuing knowledge not just an education. It is allows the fundamental understanding of who the child is and their place in the universe, society and as an individual to come forward by a process of self-accomplishment . It also demonstrates what family and friends can do to help you achieve. By the way my son is an agnostic who arrived at this philosophy through discussion with those around him---including his parents and his various instructors.
