And what about &quot;parental responsibility?&quot; Parents have a right to let their religious beliefs affect their own lives, but they do not &quot;own&quot; their children to the extend that they can allow those beliefs to endanger the child's health or future. &#10;It is important to note that those &quot;godless&quot; public schools are not anti-God, they are by law neutral on religious matters. Thus, it is perfectly possible for kids to attend those public schools and still receive all the religious instruction they need from their parents. And for those who feel that constant positive reinforcement of religious messages is necessary, there are plenty of religious schools where the child could be enrolled. &#10;I think the real issue is that these parents are afraid that the chlid is going to learn something in school that conflicts with their beliefs, and they will unable to adequately defend their beliefs against reality. The world is not flat, after all, even though the Bible clearly describes it as such in more than a dozen places. I would suggest that if a child raises questions about a matter of faith based on what he or she has learned in school, the parents need to do a little more research into what they've actually been taught to believe so they can persuasively explain it to the child. And if they can't, it is all the more reason why they should not have some special legal privilege to prevent the child from learning about the real world.
