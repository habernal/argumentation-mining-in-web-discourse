There are those who come from wealthy families, but there are also those who come from households with average or below average incomes.  My parents pulled me from a failing school, and sent me to a private school.  I have done the same for my own children and can appreciate how large a sacrifice that is.  Their tuition is nearly 10% of my gross income for the year.  Unlike their classmates, they do not have parties at country clubs, their own tablets or phones, or even cable television.  What they do have is excellent teachers, a good education, and a family that has made it work by cutting back on everything else. We are by no means poor, but we are far below what people think of as parents who send their children to private school.  We also recognize that a solid education is the major advantage they will have when they are looking to pursue their goals. We subsidize the public school with our taxes, we vote for school board members, we help our children with their homework, engage in their activities and interests, and meet with their teachers.  We willingly take on those responsibilities. It is too much to ask that each of us also fix a public school that was in trouble long before we arrived, or else allow our own children to suffer the consequence.
