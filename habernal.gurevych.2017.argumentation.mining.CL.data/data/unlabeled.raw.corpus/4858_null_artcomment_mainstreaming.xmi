She was removed from her home public school in kindergarten for disruptive behavior. She's since been in two public special ed programs that 'could do no more for her'. We managed to get her placed back in her home public school for 4th grade with an aide. Because of their lack of training and resources, they are again seeking nonpublic placement. These schools (at least in Carroll County, MD) deal with autism from a mental illness/behavioral perspective which is not right. Physical restraint and seclusion rooms are methods used which only further escalate my daughter's behavior. Even worse, there are very few if any girls (all boy classes). What is truly needed nationwide is awareness and education for all. My daughter's greatest need is to be around typical female peers to learn proper social behavior and boundaries - critical to her becoming a productive part of our community, which she is absolutely capable of becoming. By the way, she wasn't liked any more in the special ed programs than she is in the general ed arena. I invited special ed and typical kids to her 6th birthday and only one child showed up (and soon left when there wasn't anyone else there). My daughter would be in a gifted and talented program if it weren't for her social deficits (anger and frustration driven tantrums). I believe that choice is every parent's right but a child should not be forced into an alternative education setting if it cannot adequately provide what she/he needs any better than her public home school. For our situation, home schooling would be the best choice but having lost out on early diagnosis/intervention and a having to now maintain two-incomes (cost of medical, housing, bills, etc.), this is not a choice for us. I guess the battle goes on...
