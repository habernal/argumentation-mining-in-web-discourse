During her term at school she had to step back from many of the activities she normally does because she was simply too tired to do them well or enjoy them. She lost strength at gym and was too tired to enjoy dancing and theatre by friday night. &#10;At 11 years old she was able to choose to try school because she had a curiosity about it and at the end of the term she was intelligent and able enough to evaluate that there had been little to gain in terms of education and everything to lose in terms of a wider, more varied life. She decided she could do the work she needed to do far more efficiently at home and still have energy to do all the things she loves in the evening. &#10;A recent BBC story discussed how many children give up most of their out of school activities by the age of 13, either from peer pressure or the sheer weight of home work. I doubt very much mine has the slightest intention of doing so and can manage her life effectively and sensibly already. It takes some dedication of be a child who gets themselves to 8 hours of gym, 4 hours of dancing and 2hours of drama a week, with all the right stuff, having also taken part in an effective and efficient self directed education each week. &#10;Which do i think would stand her in the best stead for becoming a self motivated and well organised adult? Her current life or one sat in a classroom for 6 dead hours (her words) a day - hmmmm.. i wonder....?
