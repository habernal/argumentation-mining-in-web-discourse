(Or possibly a D.) All of the questions in it would have been at level D/C or above, and if they don't reach 20 percent they don't get a grade. This allows time to test more able pupils on the more challenging parts of the curriculum without requiring them to show that they can answer questions at G, F, and E level. (It's reasonably safe to assume that if they can answer C grade questions they would have correctly answered the easier questions.) &#10;&quot;Did the teacher really think that only knowing answers to 25% of test questions was acceptable?&quot; &#10;Again, without more information it's very hard to draw any meaningful conclusion. Some teachers set the class a test at the end of every unit of work. Others only test two or three times a year. If a pupil takes a test every two weeks, and gets 25% in one test while usually performing better, it merely indicates that they struggled with one aspect of the curriculum. (Or had a particularly bad day when they took the test, or a myriad of other factors.) If that was the case, the teacher could be right in saying that the child is doing well overall, with the obvious caveat that he/she will need support with the material that caused problems. I'd be very wary of anybody who used a single isolated test performance at primary school level as a reliable indicator of whether somebody was failing or not. It would also be necessary to compare the 25% score to the performance of others in the class. If everybody scored low then it suggests that the test was too hard or the teaching had been inadequate.
