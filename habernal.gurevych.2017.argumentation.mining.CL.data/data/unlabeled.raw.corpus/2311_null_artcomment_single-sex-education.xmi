If, while I was in high school, you had asked me whether I held back from participating in order to fit in better, I would have denied it. My proof? I'd gotten an A- from a chemistry teacher who'd announced the first day that since no girl had ever gotten more than a B from him, the girls might want to switch out if they cared about their GPA. It never occurred to me that in this class and every other one I'd looked for 'acceptable' ways to do well, and held back from 'unacceptable' ways, such as participating fully in class discussions. &#10;What an eye-opener college was! After one year, I realized that I HAD been held back, and, more importantly that I'd held myself back, and held myself back severely. We were expected to do excellent work, and it was very demanding. We were not taught 'soft' math or science. On the extracurricular side, every job had to be held by a woman. In every respect, we were told that we were expected to take a turn in the driver's seat, and we did. It opened my eyes to how little was expected of us in high school. &#10;Those four years paid off. My classmates have gone on to earn patents, start businesses, manage governmental agencies, teach thousands of students from kindergarten through graduate school, and much more. Many of us have shards of the glass ceiling in our hands from pounding our way through. &#10;I count myself lucky to have had those four years at a school focused on educating women. For middle school high school girls, I'm sure it could make the difference in whether they accept a back-seat role. It'd take a much more thorough study to convince me otherwise.
