I personally think there is no significance in keeping a child back. And I am grateful my parents didn't listen to this foolishness. Don't you think about them being a year older than everyone in their class and the teasing that will occur. &#10;From my experience, I had all the works for my parents to keep my back. I started speaking when I was four, didn't learn the alphabet till I was five, but I still turned out better than most. You have to let kids learn at their own pace. Both my sister (January baby) and I were C students until grade 8, we had more fun than studying and that's the way it should be. After grade 8 both of us became straight A students because we knew this was the time to focus. We both were valedictorians, both graduated from university in 3 years, and now are both in medical school. It didn't make a difference that I had social and developmental issues as a child because I am at the same point as my sister. &#10;For those parents that are concerned about whether or not to keep their child back: DON'T! Whether your child succeeds is dependent on your abilities as a parent in the extend to how you nurture them and let me grow as an individual.
