We discussed it with our child, and he wanted to go. He also wanted to study a complex subject we are not equipped to teach at home. Since the college were so impressed they offered an unconditional place and they impressed us at the open day, we decided he should go there to study. &#10;Sorry does that mess up your theory? We were never out to prove a point, as you appear to be implying, we were out to meet the needs of our child. &#10;When he was about to start school we had a parental choice of one, with a terrible reputation. He'd expressed interest, so he had already learned to write and add up. The local authority accused us of meddling and said he would be disruptive as children should only be taught colours and shapes for the first 6 months(!) &#10;Then they insisted on inspecting us. An inspector (a qualified teacher) who clearly disapproved, came and asked him a load of questions to check his progress and IQ. He got every one right. She then claimed her laptop had suddenly failed so she couldn't record the result. The she wrote a report saying that our failure to teach him mulit-cultural religious celebration days (at age 4!) proved we shouldn't educate at home. By then we had researched and found out she had no power over us and we got an apology from the Council. &#10;If I came across as a bit strident in my post, I apologise. It's just hard to stay relaxed in the face of so much continual, uniformed, hysterical unpleasantness, when it is directed at one, based on so little understanding or evidence...
