Every once in a while a child might stand out but it's not that often and the reason they are standing out is usually not because they seem &quot;older&quot; or &quot;younger&quot;. I'd almost be curious to do an experiment in the K class I tutor in and write down who I think is older and who I think is younger and then find out their ages and birthdays. I guarantee you that I would probably be wrong on a lot of them. Which means that they all blend very well together and it's not as big of a deal as people make it out to be. &#10;I respectfully disagree and think that as a rule it is usually VERY easy to tell who is older and who is younger in the early grades. Sure, there are always some exceptions, but it's usually pretty darn easy. Of course, we live in a town that is so small that there is only one classroom per grade level and the kids are together from k-12, so it might not be a universal thing either. &#10;PS: All three of my kiddos are May babies, and since our cut-off is July first, this has made/will make them the among the youngest in the class. For ODS (7th grade), that wasn't much of a problem although he was/is short and that can be hard for a boy. For YDS (2nd grade) it has been somewhat more of a problem academically as he has a neurological disorder and I do find myself wishing I'd held him back occasionally. On the other hand, he has amazing classmates and they accept his limitations nicely and he flourishes socially. I plan on sending DD (10 months) to school when she is supposed to unless something comes up between now and then that I can't forsee. Somebody has to be the youngest...
