My oldest starts high school this fall. My kids have &quot;owned&quot; their education basically since they day they started middle school for the most part - there are very few times that I step in even in the 6th grade. Oldest DD is managing her own education for the most part now. She registered for her high school classes and planned her next 4 years herself. She chose her honors classes and and planned her electives and knows and understands her workload. &#10;Youngest DD is already doing the work to get into the Early College high school - she's finishing 6th grade. She knows what she needs to do to be accepted to the program, what teacher recommendations she needs, the GPA, etc that she needs by the end of 8th grade, when the applications and recommendations are due (also 8th grade) and she's already doing her planning. &#10;If my kids need to contact their teachers - they call or email. They check their websites for missed homework assignments when they are absent. They get notes from classmates or the teacher. &#10;Conversely one of my sisters-in-law filled out her son's college applications and still helps him with his school projects. &#10;I've worked with interns (college aged) in my office who still depended on their parents to call their boss if they were sick, and we had one that actually had her mother call when her performance review wasn't what she expected.
