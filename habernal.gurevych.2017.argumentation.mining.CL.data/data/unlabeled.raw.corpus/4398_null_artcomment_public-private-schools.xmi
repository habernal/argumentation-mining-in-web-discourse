If you don't want to pay, then use the public system. &#10;I can't see why even one cent of public money should be going to private schools.&#10;That's what 'private' means.&#10;If all the money currently being thrown by our governments at private schools was invested in the public school system then we'd have a top class public system. &#10;No sorry you would have topclass infrastructure and still crappy results.&#10;Read OECD report &quot; Can money buy better PISA results &quot; short answer NO !&#10;Unfortunately AH, your comment misses the mark.&#10;&quot;If all the money currently being thrown by our governments at private schools was invested in the public school system then we'd have a top class public system.&quot; &#10;The reality is that more money does not equate to a better public system. As with many left-leaning viewpoints, more money often equates to more administration and wasted money, rather than efficient allocation of resources. Perhaps the analysis by academics such as Sally Young should consider why parents are increasingly choosing private, as evidenced by many comments above, rather than 'who's getting what and how much'. Sally's assertion that &quot;research that has found the most important predictors of academic success are the socio-economic status of the child's parents, the parents' own education levels and a stimulating home environment&quot; ignores the possibility these people may use their higher level of education to make an informed decision and choose private education for their children. &#10;A strong public system is important, but this is not communism. People will make their own decisions. If the public offering was strong enough, this debate would not be occurring. &#10;Hate to be the one to break it to you, but your taxes are already fully supporting an elitist two tier education system. They're called 'selective' high schools and there are currently four in Melbourne, two of which were built in recent years. Why aren't all you public school supporters whinging about this gross injustice? &#10;Hello?, I suspect there are fewer complaints about selective state schools because entry is determined entirely on merit by some sort of exam, rather than by whether the parents can pay the fees.
