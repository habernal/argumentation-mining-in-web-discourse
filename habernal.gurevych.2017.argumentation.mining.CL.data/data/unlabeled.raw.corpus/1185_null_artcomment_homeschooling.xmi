Personally I have been learning about home education specifically and education generally since some time before my first child was born 7 years ago. My wife has been researching much longer as she was a primary school teacher who swore that no child of hers would go through a system such as that which she had to help administer. We continue to learn and adapt and grow, both in our educational methods and philosophies, as our children grow and change, and in our knowledge and understanding of how we and our children fit into society and interact with it politically, socially, ethically, etc. &#10;To expect onlookers to easily understand something that we have come to know over many years of research and experience is perhaps a bit presumptuous. &#10;I appreciate the sentiment, but I feel it's misplaced. There are many damaged children in the world who come from loving parents. My opinion is that they are far more prevalent in the school system than in home education. Too much pressure on children to excel at school; unrealistic expectations of what a state-funded school system can achieve; pressure on schools to ruthlessly enforce discipline, leading to mindless 'zero tolerance' policies; pressure on teachers to provide homework even when the teachers themselves know it is pointless and, at primary level at least, counter-productive. And yes, the laissez-faire attitude that education happens in school, and the parent need not be involved in it. &#10;My feeling and experience is that such damage is less likely to happen if the parents have taken the enormous, life-changing step of accepting the practical responsibility for that education alongside the legal responsibility. The fact of taking that step seems to me to predispose the parent towards 'getting it right'. There are many factors that influence the success or otherwise of the chosen pedagogy though. These include the availability of sympathetic support; the willingness to trust one's children to access and employ their natural enthusiasm for learning; the amount of interference from persons or bodies that have irrelevant expertise (school teachers giving unasked-for advice to child-led learners, or welfare charities lobbying about national education legislation for instance) or who have a hostile attitude to the education of children otherwise than in school (some of whom have appeared in these comments), but which feel their input is nonetheless essential. &#10;Apologies for some rambling and poorly constructed sentences, but I'd like to get to bed! Another busy day tomorrow - learning continues every day, even on Saturdays and during the summer holidays!
