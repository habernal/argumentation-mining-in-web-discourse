All the author was doing was a simple trick of hydraulic social policy - that when enough momentum is behind a cause, it can not help but change the dynamics.  This is not socialist at all - but rather what lies behind every &quot;community&quot; initiative, regardless of whether the focus is a government institution or not.  For example, civil rights.  In that case, using your implied definition, the civil rights cause would constitute a socialist revolution of sorts - something that is hardly the case, to which I hope you can agree. Labels aside, you are quite right - all people support public schools, at least financially via taxation. I suspect the author was looking for something other than financial support - in the sense that she was not by any means advocating the simple and broken concept of throwing money at the problem.  The truth is, money can fix what is wrong with public schools for the simple reason that no institution can survive the contextual erosion facing students today - poorly educated parents, broken homes, and a value system that goes out of its way to avoid education and in its place substitute what reflects no more than a political pissing match over dogma.    On this basis alone, I agree with you - that the more parents that become involved, the worse public education will be.  You would have pockets of locally determined curricula subject to the political and religious whims of the moment.    Sadly, if public education were a six cylinder engine, it wouldn't make a difference how many cylinders got working right - there is no transmission to hook it up to.  Truth be told, public education should take a page out of foreign countries, in which it is for the best and brightest, with the others having to pay.  Since that will never happen here, public education will remain the repository for all of society's shortcomings: broken families, political patronage, corruption, aimless ad infinitum needs to quantify learning, low teacher pay, etc. "/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2116" language="en" documentId="3143" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Balanced and Fair" date="Aug 29, 2013 7:40PM" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://living.msn.com/family-parenting/the-family-room-blog-post?post=ab228ffc-1e99-4b37-a7b8-0b6a4c3fb240" topic="public-private-schools" thumbsUp="1" thumbsDown="0" origId="3143" notes="" title="Is it wrong to send kids to private school?"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2116"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39"/></xmi:XMI>
