My reading level was above normal. I was quiet and obedient. I graduated high school with a 3.778. I started college and dropped out three semesters in. It took me until the age of 26 to return and finally finish, while divorcing my first husband, taking care of two kids, and working full time. I did well in school as a kid, but wasn't prepared to be an adult. My sister and brother were both 5 before starting kindergarten. Neither one is less intelligent than I was, but my sister was held back in 3rd grade and there was talk of doing the same with my brother. And still, they turned out pretty much the same. Took some time to finish college. Had to find ourselves. Going in early made very little difference from my brother who went in at 5 1/2 and stayed the course, or my sister who also went in at 5 1/2 and was held back at one point. &#10;So, when the school pushed me to hold myu son back because he was a September baby, I thought long and hard. He is a lot like me in that school comes easily to him and he likes to be the &quot;smart&quot; one. But, he was a lot like my sister and brother – a bit lazy. I finally decided to tell the school &quot;no&quot;, many, many times. They could give me no really good reason other than he was young. After listening to their arguments, I realized it was because he didn't test well – not because he didn't understand the material, but because he couldn't have cared less about the test. He jsut wanted to play and the tests were in the way. Since the schools receive money based on the test results of their students, this was their pat answer. My answer was to stop letting the kid get away with being lazy, hold him to the standards and rules of the classroom, and expect something from him. Only one teacher up through 5th grade understood that. Now, he's in middle school and gets better grades than his sister (a senior) does without trying. My worry now is that it's too easy like it was for me and he will become bored and aimless. My point being, every kid is different. The teachers and administrators tend to try to shove them into a category, and I understand why. They have to meet standards. They have over 30 kids they will know for only 9 months. As the parent, knowing and understanding my children, it ismy responsibilty to make the best decision I can for him and try to get the understanding and assistance of the teachers. I dd not get much, but my kid has turned out pretty okay so far. I'm proud of both my babies and can't wait to see what they will accomplish.
