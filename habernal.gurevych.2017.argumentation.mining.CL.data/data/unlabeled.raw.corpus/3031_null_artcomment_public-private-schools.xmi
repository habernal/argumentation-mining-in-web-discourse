We live in the land of option and opportunity, certainly there is regulation in placed to make sure that everyone is treated fairly; however, bad public school system shall not be the responsibility of parents or the &quot;bad people that send their kids to private schools&quot; or all the citizen of USA. The only body to be blamed is the educational system that have been poorly ran by the government for decades which have never given the priority to structuralized and unified the education into national business.   This is the country founded on the basic of liberty including the government body that is elected by the people and for the people thus respect freedom of everyone. However freedom is a relative and abstracted concept as one have freedom to give as well as freedom to take everything else (including life).   In other word, government that we had elected follow and fulfill the will of the people elected them; thus when government was elected by a group of people that believe that they can take the job of education of their kids in their own hands, government's policy will not have education in their priority. On the other hand when the government is elected by group of people that believe education shall be government responsibility, the effort and strategy that supposed to shape the educational system into better standard do not have time to deliver the fruit that it suppose to bear because education is a process that takes time as well as it policy; since the government body change every 4 years, policy change too.   Therefore, liberty is a good thing but to achieve certain common benefit in the world sometimes we have to sacrifice liberty. Thing like education requires a long term set standard which shall not be subjected to change for the benefit for certain party, government body, corporation, etc. Education policy shall have a set goal then carries on without remorse and all mean.
