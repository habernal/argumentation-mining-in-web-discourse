The parent is at liberty to choose the style and setting of the education so long as it meets the above criteria. &#10;The National Curriculum only applies to certain schools so no subject is compulsory in Elective Home Education. Neither are exams and neither are SATs (which, by the way, are not compulsory ever anyway but one does have to opt out of them on behalf of one's child) &#10;The definition we usually use to define a &quot;suitable&quot; education as above is a piece of case-law which goes &#10;Basically this means as a home educator one should provide an education, by whatever means or philosophy, which prepares your child (taking into account the limitations of any special needs) for life after childhood. &#10;The Local Authority can, if it suspects a suitable education is NOT taking place, enquire about the educational provision and intervene if necessary. Without any information a local authority can assume there is no education taking place but in order to enforce state education by attendance at school they must take the parents to court where they can defend their position by showing evidence to the contrary. &#10;Yes I have missed out a couple of good practice steps from the above but as far as the actual legislation is concerned this is it, in a nutshell. &#10;Welfare/safeguarding is a COMPLETELY different subject in law. Educational setting, just like religion and ethnicity, do not change the Authorities responsibilities and role in this regard. &#10;To assume that being in school is a safety net as regards welfare is not necessarily true in either law or experience. Otherwise there would be a lot less school attending children who were abused (and this is not a dig....abuse can often be well hidden for years). All people - private or employed by the state - have a duty to report suspected abuse. All local authorities have a duty to respond proportionately within the law to such reports. &#10;Yes there are children &quot;at risk&quot; in some home educating families, the law of probabilities would suggest nothing else, but as far as I know these families are already known. In my years of experience training local Authorities I have NEVER come across the negligent or abusive death of a child who was educated at home where that child was not already known to be at risk or possibly at risk of harm. And I always ask. Home educating a child does not allow a parent to slip away from Social Services scrutiny where it is required. &#10;Alison Sauer Trainer of Local Authorities in Elective Home Education"/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2735" language="en" documentId="1179" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="AlisonSauer" date="30 July 2010 6:10pm" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/6911096" topic="homeschooling" thumbsUp="3" thumbsDown="0" origId="1179" notes="" title="Home education: precious, not dangerous"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="67"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="68" end="146"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="147" end="345"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="346" end="611"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="612" end="718"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="719" end="936"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="63" sofa="1" begin="937" end="1349"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="1350" end="1496"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="71" sofa="1" begin="1497" end="1687"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="75" sofa="1" begin="1688" end="2134"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="79" sofa="1" begin="2135" end="2666"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="83" sofa="1" begin="2667" end="2735"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59 63 67 71 75 79 83"/></xmi:XMI>
