Boy #3 (pregnant right now) will be born the end of July and the cut off is August 1st here. I think this trend is interesting. I think it all depends on the child. With my oldest, I felt like he would need a little extra help so I have him in 2 years of preschool (started at 3.5) to help him. I have seen a big change in him and it wasn’t until he was at school and had that social interaction that he grew up maturity wise. With DS2, I might put him in 1 year of preschool before school just to get him use to a classroom setting. He’s only 2 right now but already knows his letters by site, can count to 30, and is oddly mature for a 2 year old. If he wasn’t so little I think people would think he was older then he is. I think parents are the best judge at what is best for their kids. What I HATE is people who red shirt so their kid can be physically bigger then all the other kids giving them an advantage in sports. That is stupid in my mind. My husband was actually held back in 3rd grade. He was an average student but way smaller then everyone else. He said it was the best thing for him to be held back (he was still almost always smaller) but repeating a grade helped him gain confidence in himself and helped him to do much better in school because of that confidence. I believe in holding a kid back, but not red shirting.
