MY opinion -- if you have a 4 year old that can read well and write well (along with very basic....separate from mom, follow basic instructions, etc).....wouldn't you be doing them a disservice by waiting a year to send them to Kindergarten? (I'm not referring to kids with actual physical or social delays.) EVEN if they might be a little socially immature? &#10;Apparently I've done my oldest daughter a disservice. She was a THREE year old who could read well, write ok, and had no problem separating from me. She had to wait another two years for school. &#10;Just as a 3-year old, though, I could see a very clear gap in maturity between her and the average 4-year old at her preschool. When she started kindergarten in the fall of 2010, she was way ahead of everybody academically, but the school did a decent job of differentiating for language arts, and she was with her social peer group. Actually I think she's slightly immature and silly-acting, for her age. &#10;I have a July birthday child who is starting kindergarten this fall at age barely 5. She's not the academic superstar her big sister is, by a long shot. I bet a lot of parents would hold her back, as she's also very petite. But, we're sending her. Socially, she's fine, and she has a fantastic work ethic. Even though she's only 4, this kid will try her little heart out, and usually succeed, at whatever she attempts. But, she does have to really work at it, unlike my older daughter, for whom everything academic is so easy. I can't imagine my older daughter putting forth such effort; despite her smarts, she's lazy. And I think ultimately, that may take her (younger daughter) further in life.
