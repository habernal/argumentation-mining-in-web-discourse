She has a fantastic support worker 1:1 who has supported her since pre-school. &#10;It has become more apparent over the last year that the gap has widened between Amy (her progress/development) and her peers. The school, basically, want her out. Although they have not said this to mum directly, she gets the impression thats what they want - which must be an awful thing to feel. &#10;Recently the school has had support from an autism service who have observed Amy &amp; offered advice. &#10;They are now looking to 'close' the case, which means they will meet with mum, senco &amp; support worker and talk through the advice they have given over the past few months. They will also make future recommendations. &#10;The mum, paula, has had a letter, inviting her to the closing meeting and letting her know who will be attending. &#10;Not just the senco, autism services &amp; support worker will be attending but also an&#10;She knows that they will all be suggesting that she looks at special schools &amp; moves Amy there, but wants her to remain at the mainstream school. Amy is happy, she has a supportive support worker who does a lot with her to meet her needs &amp; mum feels that she wont get this same provision at a special school. &#10;The meeting was just a low key closing meeting which has now turned into something a bit more serious. &#10;She is cross that an educational psychologist has been invited, who has only observed Amy once for an hour, as well as a speech &amp; language therapist who hasnt even seen Amy at school! How can they offer advice/recommendations when they dont know the child?! &#10;What im wanting is some advice for Paula (Amy's mum), her rights to keep her child at the mainstream school &amp; whether the school have gone the wrong way about this (which I feel they have) &#10;Any suggestions, advice is welcome!"/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2048" language="en" documentId="4938" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Sally M(61)" date="15-12-10 21:07" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://www.netmums.com/coffeehouse/advice-support-40/special-needs-disabilities-support-502/507028-mainstream-school-trying-get-my-child-into-special-school-all.html" topic="mainstreaming" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="4938" notes="" title="Mainstream school trying to get my child into a special school"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="165"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="166" end="335"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="336" end="634"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="635" end="734"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="735" end="951"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="952" end="1066"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="63" sofa="1" begin="1067" end="1149"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="1150" end="1459"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="71" sofa="1" begin="1460" end="1563"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="75" sofa="1" begin="1564" end="1822"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="79" sofa="1" begin="1823" end="2012"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="83" sofa="1" begin="2013" end="2048"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59 63 67 71 75 79 83"/></xmi:XMI>
