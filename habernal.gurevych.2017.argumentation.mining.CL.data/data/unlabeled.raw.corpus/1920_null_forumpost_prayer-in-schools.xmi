The question is when and where she was reading the Bible and in what manner. Was she supposed to be doing something else while she was reading the Bible? I suspect that there is more to the story than we are being told. &#10;Generally speaking, a student may read the Bible in school as long as it isn't during times when that student is supposed to be doing something else, and as long as it isn't disruptive. In fact, it would be a violation of the Constitution for a school to make rules against reading the Bible unless it was part of a policy that banned lots of books. If his was a case of a student privately and quietly reading the Bible outside of class time, then she should contact the ACLU. &#10;It is still a violation of the Constitution whether anyone cares or not. I think that there are probably some who do care but are afraid of &quot;christian&quot; retaliation if they speak up. That was what happened in the Santa Fe, TX case that resulted in the Supreme Court decision that declared that prayer as a part of the pregame activities to be unconstitutional. &#10;I guess you didn't learn much in school. It has nothing to do with agreement or disagreement with a religion. It has to do with the majority using the government to impose a single religion on everyone. In the Santa Fe case, the plaintiffs were Christians. &#10;Wouldn't it be nice if you had actually learned in school what the Constitution means instead of just what it says? I'll explain. Hopefully you will be able to follow. &#10;Let's begin with the Fourteenth Amendment, section 1.The effect of this amendment is to extend the application of the First Amendment to all levels of government. Violations of the religious rights of citizens have been struck down as denials of equal protection of the laws. &#10;There are two religious clauses in the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has stated that the purpose of the Establishment Clause is to prevent government from endorsing or supporting religion. That means no Ten Commandment erections in State Courthouses, no Bible displays on court house lawns, no school endorsed prayers in class, before football games, or at graduation. &#10;That's the second religious clause in the First Amendment, the Free Exercise Clause. The Supreme Court has stated that the purpose of this clause is to prevent the government from outlawing or seriously burdening a person's pursuit of whatever religion, and whatever religious practices he chooses. &#10;However, the case as you state it is not a violation of the Free Exercise Clause. The practice of your religion does not depend on whether or not you are able to pass school rules that require my children to participate in your prayers. The Supreme Court has also found that calling the prayer &quot;optional&quot; is not sufficient, since they are required to be present while you practice your religion, and by their enforced silence approve of your practice. That is clearly a violation of both clauses. You may practice your religion however you want but you may not use my government to impose it on everyone. If you want Ten Commandment erections, put them up at your church, not in government buildings. If you want to pray before a football game, do so, but you may not use the PA system and pray as part of pregame activities. &#10;By the way, some people of Santa Fe, TX decided that they would pray before football games anyway. At the decided time, the stood up and began to pray and were totally ignored by other PA announcements and the cheering crowd. But no one interfered with their prayers. They didn't even attempt a prayer at the next game.
