However, what is missing in much of public schools is a value system that reflect good community ideals. I understand the frustration when teachers do not feel rewarded by supporting families who show up for teacher parent meetings and awards banquets of their kids accomplishments.  That is very common in a lot of American Families.  They just do not have the public support for their kids as many teachers would like to see.  As to over paid, I know teachers in some districts in Arkansas where they make between 60,000 -115,000 as public teachers.  I do not disagree with their earnings, but much of the union practices is based on tenure ship and not on performance.  Teachers in all cities fear pay based on performance because it is not fair giving the types of students some teachers have the challenge to teach.  I know of some teachers making 72000 a year and they have an average of less than 5 students a week.  That is why many school district's are going broke because the Unions have ran the cost up with out making financial responsible decisions on the outcomes.  As to private schools, many parents feel they have a complete package in academics, family and church values with the emphasis on value education where teaching has a moral point in all that we do. The reason I know this is because I am a public school teacher and I also support Governor Jindahl of Louisiana who wants to see low income families have the opportunity to leave schools that are failing.  The real issue that Unions are fearful of is accountability.  American families see injustice when teachers and school districts are not accountable to the families who pay their salaries.
