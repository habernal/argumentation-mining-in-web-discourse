I agree to a degree. I just enrolled my daughter and son ( 6 + 4yrs old) in a private catholic school, my daughter was at a public school for kindergarted and had a super super awesome teacher and a wonderful experience. Her K-teacher will forever be in our hearts for that. Also, I had enrolled her for the 1st 2 weeks of the 1st grade, and also had an awesome teacher. We went against the &quot;if it ain't broke dont fix it&quot; well we enrolled our kids into the private school and we just began 2 days ago. My reason for doing so you ask, well just because I was totally into homework and studying and making everything fun and nice. Other parents at the school were ghetto as hell. My daughter had really cute friends and all but their parents were drug users, living in motels, and just gross. I know that not all the kids there had parents like that, but it's much less likely at a private school. That was my reason, I felt that there would be more children with parents that are thinking and acting like me, instead of what I would witness while picking up and dropping of my daughter and her asking me questions about why so n so's mom is like that.
