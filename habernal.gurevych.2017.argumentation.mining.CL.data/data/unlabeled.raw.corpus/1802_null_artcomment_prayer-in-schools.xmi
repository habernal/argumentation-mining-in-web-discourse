Children do not know anything unless they are taught otherwise they will learn from observing. Children are like sponges they absorb more than we think. If children are not learning anything at all about God at home (how unfortunate it is- and for the rest of their family)then why not teach them at school? Yes others may not believe at all in God however what about those who do or would believe in God if we only gave them a chance. No, prayer wasn’t banned from school but the teachers were banned from teaching about it and the teaching of the Bible. A simple prayer was banned in 1962 :“Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers, and our country” Which was conducted at the beginning of the day. A value free atmosphere will lead to chaos. Jesus said “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these”-Matthew 19:14 And when Jesus said in Matthew 6:5-6 “And when you pray , do not be like the hypocrites,for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your father, who is unseen. Then you father tho sees what is done in secret, will reward you.” He did not mean that He did not like prayer in school but He meant that you should pray from your heart being true and not pray just so people can see you being a false witness. Idle time is the devils workshop-The devil is our adversary-our enemy. America needs to invite God into more of our daily happenings which includes public school for the sake of the childrens soul.
