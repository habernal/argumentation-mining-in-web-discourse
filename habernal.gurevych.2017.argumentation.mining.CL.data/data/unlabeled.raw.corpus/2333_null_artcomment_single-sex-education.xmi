A 'report' against single sex education by members of the American Council for CoEducational Schooling is problematic on many levels. Importantly, a report is likely more opinion than evidence. It is also interesting that at least two of the members of that council (Diane Halpern and Lise Eliot) have written about sex differences in learning and behaviour. &#10;I am familiar with the work of Gurian and Sax and for both it appears that their fundamental messages are not about discrimination but about meeting the needs of all children and taking into account the possibility that single sex education may work for some children. There are many scientists and educators who continue to research in this area and are adding a great deal of evidence to the depth of literature suggesting that differences do exist and may impact on learning and behaviour...both Halpern and Eliot have made such assertions in their own books. &#10;There is a long history of single sex and coed schools in Australia...each has its share of success stories and areas for improvement. There is a growing trend to offer single sex opportunities in coed schools that are also showing some amazing results. Perhaps the dialogue to be had is how do we continue to meet the needs of boys and girls in ways that accomodate similarities and differences rather than this tired argument suggesting that boys and girls are neurologically identical. Science should never be used to discriminate but surely it should not be ignored either, especially when: &#10;Neuroscientists are uncovering anatomical, chemical and functional differences between the brains of men and women…these variations occur throughout the brain, in regions involved in language, memory, emotion, vision, hearing and navigation…researchers are working to determine how these sex-based variations relate to differences in male and female cognition and behavior. - Dr Larry Cahill (Sci Amer May 2005) "/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1986" language="en" documentId="2333" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="M Nagel" date="September 28th, 2011" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://community.nytimes.com/comments/www.nytimes.com/2011/09/23/education/23single.html?sort=oldest&amp;offset=4" topic="single-sex-education" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="2333" notes="" title="Single-Sex Education Is Assailed in Report"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="413"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="414" end="977"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="978" end="1573"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="1574" end="1986"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51"/></xmi:XMI>
