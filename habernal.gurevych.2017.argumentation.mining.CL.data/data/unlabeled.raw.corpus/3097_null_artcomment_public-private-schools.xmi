My kids all started out in the public school systems, and our public school systems FAILED my children miserably.  When you run across teachers who are in or close to tenure, who give up on teaching at that point, what do you do?  What do you do when the teachers use their &quot;school time&quot; as social hour with the other teachers and staff, instead of doing their jobs and actually, oh I don't know, TEACHING!?!?  What happens when your kids are forced to go to a school, where a proper education is the last thing on the minds of the parents whose children attend, as well as the teachers who are supposed to be educating them?  What happens if you have a disabled child in the public school system, or a child on an IEP, and the school doesn't have the resources available to give your child a descent education?  How about dealing with a school who either allows bullying, or looks the other way when it happens?  Our schools and our students have lost out on so much in the last few years due to tax cuts, at least here in Tennessee.  Our kids don't even have P.E. any more; no art, no music, no recess, no field trips, an no money to buy books.  The schools that do have P.E. send the kids off to the gym for Play Station or Wii aerobics.  What the heck kind of physical fitness is that, and what the heck is that teaching our children?  If there is art or music, the parents are required to provide the supplies.  My children are still technically a part of the public school system, but we use a program called K12.  Let me tell you, it is the BEST education my children have ever received.  If by some chance Tennessee loses the K12 program, I will rip my children out of the public schools completely, and I will opt to home school them myself.  When hard working American's bust their rear ends to pay their taxes, we expect a good education for our tax paying dollars.  More often than not, this is NOT the case.  Just ask the legislature here in TN, and the teachers who actually care about their students (the ones who actually pride themselves on their careers), why it is that TN DOE had to pass a new regulation for teachers salaries.  Look in to it!  Salary is now based on teacher ability; and that wouldn't have had to be put into play, if the teachers were actually doing what they get paid to do!  If I had the money to send my kids to a private school, I would do it in a heartbeat.  Why should my kids have to suffer, and lose out on a descent education, because our public school systems can't cut it?  Public schools are great for kids who want to make a living working at McDonald's.  One would assume that a GOOD parent, would want more for their child than that!
