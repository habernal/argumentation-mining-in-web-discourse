Law Enforcement, and as of late these people are also burdened with College loans which they are no eligible for forgiveness of those loans, through a complicated 10 year Federal Program which is about  an outstanding deficit of 1 Trillion Dollars to the American tax payers as it stands now. Check the facts I post here in response to this incomplete, (this is the grade she would get in my class and I am not a teacher), story, all of them are on line as I post, and some I read today and are incorporated here. In the 50's there were classes for those with learning problems as well as what were considered to be handicap and the had special teachers known as Special Education teacher who were trained to teach this kids and not just to have them over looked as they are today, and now another point this arrogant writer left out are the Special Private schools for these children so those who send their children must bear this stigma the woman has the audacity to label them with, how crass and crude and compassionless can she be. But then the source of her remarks are just the her remarks base =d in her biased opinion which has major flaws and her argument stand as nothing more than moot to the problem of getting our schools and our children better educated and to slander others who have other things to face which she has failed to address, which leads one to believe she also need an education on manners as well as her ability to research a problem with out the biased . So the end result of this writer theory in only making her view the priority, without any provable fact(s), but an Assumption of her being right and touching only on what she wanted to support her point of view, and again I say without doubt, she has not done her job but she has been paid and is safe and secure in her ivory tower where she feels she can look out at others and not only slander them but to demean their Humanity and the love and wishes for their children to have more and better lives, rich or poor all parents want these things, especially the education they need to compete is this world in the future when they are left without our love and support as we pass on, and want that dream to be true, as I do for my Grand Daughters, and Great Grand Sons.
