Teachers don't have a right to be bad. &#10;I didn't home school my kids but I did take them out of a local failing school and send them to a religious school which has an ethos of 25% exam mark as unacceptable. I also pay for extra tuition after school, something that I really can't afford but I have chosen to do and go without holidays abroad. &#10;More a knee jerk reaction mate , based on just some throw away comments in an article written by someone none of us knows &#10;I can only go by this article. CiF posts are all throw away comments!!!! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ &#10;You're perfectly entitled to have a view on Teachers i am not trying to take that away from you , my wife as a Teacher also has a view on some of the appaling attitudes of parents , however , i did say that there are bad Teachers my wife as a teacher knows there are bad Teachers in the same way she knows there are bad parents etc etc etc &#10;People in all walks are just humans and we are not all perfect&#10;None of us has a right to be bad mate , no matter where we work or whether we are a parent.&#10;i always joke with my wife that considering the monumental amount of paperwork she has to deal with and targets etc etc etc that she has any time to actually Teach. Sadly what with previous Governments and the current one will no doubt be any better Teachers have almost had the enthusiasm sucked out of them by constant Government diktat "/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1971" language="en" documentId="809" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Ghostworld" date="07 January 2011 2:11pm" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/9053295" topic="homeschooling" thumbsUp="6" thumbsDown="0" origId="809" notes="" title="Why I home school my children"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="46"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="47" end="122"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="123" end="341"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="342" end="397"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="398" end="524"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="525" end="829"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="63" sofa="1" begin="830" end="952"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="953" end="1135"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="71" sofa="1" begin="1136" end="1476"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="75" sofa="1" begin="1477" end="1539"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="79" sofa="1" begin="1540" end="1631"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="83" sofa="1" begin="1632" end="1971"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59 63 67 71 75 79 83"/></xmi:XMI>
