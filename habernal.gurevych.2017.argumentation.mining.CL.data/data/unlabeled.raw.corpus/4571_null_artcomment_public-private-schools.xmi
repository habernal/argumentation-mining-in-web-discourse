They enrol fewer students with learning difficulties or poor family backgrounds. It is therefore hardly surprising that they often do better than public comprehensives in poorer areas. However, when public schools are allowed to select students (leaving aside they argument whether they should) they do far better academically. In NSW, 9 of the 10 best-achieving secondary schools in NAPLAN are public selectives. The 'elite' private schools that get close have a per-student income (government+parental fees) more than twice as large as that of the top government selectives (SMH 'league tables' of NSW schools, based on MySchool website). This is also reflected in NSW HSC results. &#10;While the argument that removing all government funding to private schools would result in 'swamping' the public system is grossly overstated (many private school parents wouldn't send their darlings to mix with the riff-raff whatever the cost) there is some truth in the proposition that there is some saving of public money by parents eschewing the public system, consequently there is some justification for a limited subsidy - but it must come after public schools are adequately resourced. However, for a school to attract any public money, it should be required to abide by the public standards imposed on other institutions - namely, anti-discrimination law, both in terms of enrolment policy and staffing. Dismissing teachers or students due to aspects of their private lives, such as their sexual preference, not wearing a veil or family arrangements, would be illegal not only in public schools, but workplaces and public institutions generally - yet there are instances of this occurring. Would most defenders of private schools accept religious, eg Sharia, law applying elsewhere?
