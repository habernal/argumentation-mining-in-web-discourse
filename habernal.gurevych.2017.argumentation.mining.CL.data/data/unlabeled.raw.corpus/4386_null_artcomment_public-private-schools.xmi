It is not just the wealthy who send their children to private schools. &#10;&quot;Even more unusually, Australian ''private'' schools receive extensive public funding.&quot;&#10;Substantially less funding than the government saves by the child being taken out of the public system. On a per student basis an average of $12,639 of taxpayer dollars for a public student and $6,607 for non-government students. In other words, public students cost taxpayers twice as much as private students. &#10;I am sure you are gloating that you are paying $12-20K per annum for a basic education that is probably equal to or marginally better than a public system should and usually does provide. &#10;If that is how you wish to spend your dollars that is fine for you. But your attitude is slowly forcing every one else into a similar decision. Tuition or rent? And it is not like the private schools are not ripping you off. They have $100s millions in assets and still you are happy to pay more? THINK! &#10;Marginally better? Well that depends on where you live. I chose to send my daughter to a private school where the average grade 3 NAPLAN result is higher than the average grade 7 NAPLAN result across most bans in the local state high school. And that's not the school telling me, that's data from the government myschool website. Fast forward to grade 12 and 30% of all graduates from my daughter's school get in the top 5% of tertiary entrance ranking. &#10;Not to mention the sense of community- the school involves the parents far more thoroughly than I was involved when she was in a government school. Then there's the fact that there's 16 in her class not 30. Finally there's all the co curricular opportunity- music, swimming squad, overseas travel etc. &#10;It's money well spent in my opinion.&#10;I can guarantee you the public schools my children my children attend are far better than the private options. NAPLAN results for starters were much higher and they dont have to sit through an hour of brainwashing everyday. &#10;repeat after me students&#10;science is rubbish&#10;the world is flat&#10;it was created by a god&#10;dinosaurs NEVER existed&#10;girls are 3rd class&#10;and hate hate hate....&#10;Why are you so offended that a person would pay 12-15 thousand so their child can be in a better cohort. The author pionts out that the cohort is important. But rather than allowing you to send your child into a better cohort see DEMANDS you send it into a lower cohort. Not for your childs beniefit but for the lower cohorts. THINK about it. &#10;Do you honestly believe that everyone can afford a private education for their child? I've seen people work hard and sacrifice time spent with their family, simply to put food on the table. Not every person was born into privilege and/or experienced success in their education (private or public) that allowed them to earn six-figure salaries as an adult, but that doesn't mean they don't work hard or make sacrifices. Please don't reinforce the stereotype of the privileged with such naive comments. &#10;And that's the same reason we should pay everyone $25 per week to drive to work rather than use public transport &#10;Gordon,&#10;You can always find plausible sounding reasons for re-establishing the class system that was largely broken down in Australia by the early and universal availability of quality public education. Indeed many of the great statesmen of the world have pointed out that the fundamental basis of a vibrant democracy is a universal public education where the outcome for the student is based upon academic merit rather then the depth of pockets of parents. &#10;Those who wish to seek unfair advantages for their children will always find the most plausible and even allegedly high-minded reasons to justify that unfairness. &quot;Human rights are not only violated by terrorism, repression or assassination, but also by unfair economic structures that creates huge inequalities.&quot; Pope Francis I &#10;&quot;It is seriously disabling for students going to exclusive fee-paying schools that they see so little of society,&quot; he told the Brighton College educational conference. &quot;They mix in a very narrow social medium. They don't, for the most part, meet the most of the rest of society, including those who don't have parents of substantial means. If what we want is a one-nation society, it is not good for them and it is not good for wider society.&quot; Lord Adonis (Will Hutton The Guardian May 11, 2013) &#10;Gordon&#10;I would gladly pay the extra tax needed to have all kids get a quality education in the state system. Private education is the most socially divisive aspect of Australian society &#10;What's your postcode smilingjack? Let's look at the NAPLAN results and see if your assertion stands up. &#10;I sent my 3 kids to Catholic school &amp; am very glad i did. Comparing them to their friends who went to public schools only reinforces my opinion that the public system is broken. It was a struggle paying for the fees (although they were comparatively modest) but to me it was worth it. I don't mind my taxes subsidising public school students even though my kids get less back, because to me their future is more important than my comforts. As for cultural diversity - well I see cultures and colours of all sorts when I visit the school. Fewer bogans maybe - but I'm not worried about that omission. &#10;ArghONaught - &quot;equal or marginally better!&quot;... Pure comedy!&#10;So many chip's on shoulders in reading these comments&#10;&quot;abc&quot;, you are right, everyone has a choice to send their children to either private or public, their money, and their decision. &#10;This article has different ideas, if you can afford send your kids to private school, then why I am Tax payer to subsidy that choice? on the hand my kids go to public school where lacking of funds, low teaching quality, and put up with low antisocial behaviours? My money should be funding public. &#10;Why I send my kids to public instead of private 2 minutes down the road? I graduated from Public, now I am top of my professional field, where I see the world with open eyes, more compassion toward everyone. I am expecting my kids struggling with all the challenges in the Public school, but they will be emerged as a better person, stronger, more determination, and more willing to take enterpreneurship risk. &#10;Too true smiling Jack.&#10;If you as a parent really care about your child, send them to a public school.&#10;Assuming you will have saved $20K per year for 12 years or $240K gives them a nice little unit close to their university where they can rent out the other bedroom. &#10;To be impoverished by private schooling, then by university fees, then by the house and mortgage; breeds kids who may be smart and elitist but also conservative and boring and will never take a risk in their life or think outside the square. Never interact with real people only an elite and be out of touch with society. &#10;That's why NAPLAN is detested by private schools since it is a window on the truth.&#10;Parents who send their kids to private schools are usually elite snobs, and their kids will more or less be tradies anyway. &#10;Untrue Gordon. You fail completely to take into account that if private school subsidies were removed entirely the savings on the ~10% who would send their kids to private schools whether they had government help or not would make up for the additional cost on the drift back to public schools. It's social engineering and a gift to the private school lobby/religious institutions plain and simple. &#10;I agree with mikebasil&#10;When i went to a public school. I was bullied and picked on. I even had some boy punch me (a girl) and when i told the school. they did NOTHING about it. my mother was fed up with the bullying i got and enrolled me to a private school. &#10;It was the best thing that happened to me. From the very first day. I made friends and felt accepted. The whole grade was friends with each other. Of course their were kids who did not like each other but they just stayed out of each others ways. In 8th grade i even became one of the more popular kids and got voted by my peers as class as homeroom leader. I couldn't believe it. The kid who got badly bullied in public school became a popular kid in private school. I am an adult now but i could not talk enough about how great the kids were in private school. NO RIFF RAFF! &#10;ZZZzzz - you may not have been bullied and may gave been 'popular' at your private school - however, judging by the number of grammatical errors in your post, the money your parents paid was wasted: as far as your education went........ &#10;Dirk diggler, thanks for pointing it out. I am 27, a single female and I own my own Home in the inner west of sydney that would be paid for by the time i am 30. Did not get any financial help from anyone. my spelling might suck but i bet i am doing better than you when you were 27.
