I had my son in public school up to the 7th grade.In 7th grade he got expelled for looking up something he shouldnt have on the internet.The reason he did this was,he didnt know what this thing was,other than a lighthearted movie on popcornflix.the school explelled him.According to public shool rules,they are to look at each expulsion case individually. They did not.The told me that when it was found that he did not visit any other terroristic sites on the inter net they would allow him back (2-3 days) 7 days later I get a call confiming that he had never looked at any questionable sites.When can he come back I asked.We have decided,she told me,that we are going to downgrade his expusion to long therm suspension.He can,t come back for the rest of the year.I asked her why that was if she found that he hadn't visited any other sites and she wounldn't give me a straight answer.Just said his grades wouldnt go down.They did he left therer with F's.I enrolled him in an alternative school.Next thing I knew I am getting invitations from his public school for him to come back. My sister told me that they would be loosing money if he left and they would try to talk us into returning.That is just what they did,even giving him school supplies.They came in handy at the new school.His new school is amazing.He brings home work that I didn't see until college.People all over town listen to him talk and ask me where does this child go to school and do they have one in their town.He is more confident,respectful,considerate and responsible than ever.I will never send him back there even if I have to move to a box.
