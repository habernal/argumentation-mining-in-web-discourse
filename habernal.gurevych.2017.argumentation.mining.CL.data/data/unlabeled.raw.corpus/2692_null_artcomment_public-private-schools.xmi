Her sense of reality is so off base that she might as well be walking the surface of Mars. It is nice to think if you just do this one thing, everything will be perfect. Lady, life isn't perfect. Far from it. Everyone invests in &quot;public school&quot; by paying taxes and look how well that has worked out. California has some of the highest taxes which is suppose to go to education but pads the pockets of administrators. I doubt parents who can afford to send their children to private school would forgo their children's private education in order to make &quot;public school better.&quot; If the answer is to send all children to public school then why doesn't Obama, politicians, actors, the rich send their children to public school? People are selfish by nature and as parents you want the best for your children especially when it comes to education. I think the only way to improve public schools is to be accountable for every dollar that comes in. Private schools are accountable for every dollar that comes in and they have to spend it wisely. Ultimately there is no easy answer but public schools should go back to &quot;teaching&quot; and not making little human drones. The rich keep getting richer and the poor getting poorer because of this thinking. Shame on this writer for making people who send their children to private school the enemy. This writer represents everything wrong with our society.
