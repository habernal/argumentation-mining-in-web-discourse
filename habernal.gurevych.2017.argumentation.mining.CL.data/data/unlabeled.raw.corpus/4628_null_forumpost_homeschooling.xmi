The kids that HS here are allowed to participate in Public School sports if they so choose as long as they are in the area assigned to that school to begin with. &#10;All of my boys have done public and I have two that are exceptional students both NHS and one straight As in advanced classes from young age. Both of these boys though are self motivated and never had to be told to do homework or anything. They just did what they were supposed to do naturally (Thank you Lord!) &#10;I have another that fits the &quot;can't stay in my seat&quot; issue. He graduated but with difficulty and if they had an outdoor program, OR I had the patience myself for Home S at that time, would have been better for him. His teachers used to make him run the track some days before class or during to get some of the jitters out. &#10;My GS depending on how he cognitively tests out (too young to tell yet but was born with some complications that &#10;affect) prior to school may be home schooled. Will i do the teaching myself? No. I will hire someone to work with him here. But the home school community gets together all the time for outings, field trips, PE, and all kinds of things. Home Schooling programs have come a long way incorporating socialization, sports and activities into learning. &#10;What i don't understand locally is the Private School here. People are paying 1500 a month for child to attend, they have some unaccredited teachers, and they don't put out any kids that score any higher that the Public School. I can send my kid to public school and hire tutors for every subject for that price. I guess i just don't understand it. And NO it is not a Christian/church affiliated school. I understand why some parents chose those schools. &#10;I do want to add though that I am a successful person with degree. My MOTHER filled out my college app way back when. I, at the time, did not want to go to college and wanted to backpack through Europe. I was there at the time my mother did this. When i came home for what I thought was going to be a brief visit, I was sent to GM and told I was accepted. Now how is that for Mom taking charge? Now who knows if i would have been just as successful if I had completed my tour and come home and did it all myself BUT I will give my mom credit for the push anyway. Why not?
