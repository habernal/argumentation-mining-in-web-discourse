For him, he develop epilepsy at age two and since has had to deal with 3-4 grand mals per day and over 100 myoclonic seizures per day. In January 2011 our son began the keogenic diet and by December 2011 our son became seizure-free. &#10;Pretty much the moment our son stopped having seizures, he started to develop like a normal child he age. Before his seizures stopped he was unable to learn, drooled on himself constantly, and was so physically tired all the time...that his ability to do anything was compromised. That all ended last year, and since he has had to play major catch-up. He had to learn all of the things that most kids learn in preschool through 2nd grade. Things like circle time, reading, math, etc. &#10;Our son's second grade teacher has NEVER held a child back in the near 20 years that she has been teaching. When we started thinking about it last year, she was conflicted. We had a choice – move him ahead with his peers with the knowledge that he would need a 1:1 in the classroom to consistently explain things – including spending lots of time out of the classroom to play catch up. OR, we could hold him back so that he could learn the foundations of education (reading/writing, etc) – so that he could be successful at school. &#10;Many friends and family tried to talk us out of keeping him back – some of whom are educators. After all, most studies do indicate that its better to have struggling children move ahead. However, what do you do about a child who has always been a sick child....who becomes normal? Its not like he was a little bit behind. &#10;I am happy to report that my son in just 10 months after becoming seizure free is nearly at grade level in education. He was absolutely FINE with staying back, and now has friends – lots of them. Nobody wanted to be friends with the &quot;sick&quot; kid before, and he is in a situation where nobody really knew his past – he's simply like the &quot;new&quot; kid in class. &#10;I sit with my son every night and he reads to me, and I'm in awe how fast he is catching up. His self confidence has SKYROCKETED. After years of him never being into sports – he is excited to start basketball next year. After years of never having friends – he has a ton of them. But most importantly – he feels good about staying back. &#10;Good luck to those who have to make the decision. Its never an easy one. But make the decision based on your OWN child and what you think their needs are...not some study that say's no. Do what you think is right for your own child.
