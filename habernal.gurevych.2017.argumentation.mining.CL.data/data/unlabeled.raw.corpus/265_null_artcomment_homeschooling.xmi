That means that not only are their children excused from attending school- as those educated under the state's home-school statute are- but they also are exempt from all government oversight. &#10;This is true, but misleading. Virginia's religious exemption law may be unusual, but many states do not regulate homeschooling, either for religious or non-religious reasons. States vary on their amount of oversight. Some states do not require families to notify the state education dept. of their intent to homeschool. HSLDA.org has useful information on every state's requirements. Virginia is not an outlier regarding oversight. &#10;Readers should wonder how many Virginia homeschoolers use the religious exemption. The article mentioned the statistics for Buckingham County (1 student, jumping to 10 the next year), but this doesn't begin to characterize the state as a whole. I was discouraged (by other homeschoolers) from using the religious exemption in VA because of the difficulty of proving that my objection to public schools was religiously motivated. &#10;The article was certainly more balanced than many, and raised the issue of the religious exemption in a respectful way, but the religious exemption does not characterize most Virginia homeschoolers. Moreover, it's hard to feel that this young man's education has been a failure, when he is clearly motivated to learn and improve himself, and has the ability to find help towards those goals. Blue-collar Buckingham to Georgetown U. is a success story.
