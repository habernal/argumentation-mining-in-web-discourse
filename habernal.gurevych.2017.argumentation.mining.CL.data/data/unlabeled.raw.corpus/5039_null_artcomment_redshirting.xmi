I CAN understand it, however, if they genuinely feel that their child is not yet ready for school. My son was born in mid-august, and in our school district, the cut-off birthday is September 1st. So if we put him into school when we &quot;should&quot;, then he'll be one of the youngest in his class -- he'll have JUST turned 5, whereas some kids in his class will almost be 6. So his father and I have agreed to monitor the situation, and monitor his progress when he goes to preschool, and if we don't feel he's ready for school, we have no qualms about holding him back another year, if needs be. &#10;Of course, as the trend continues, you run the risk of everybody doing it, to the point where it'll get ridiculous and kids won't be starting school until age 7 or later. I would suggest that in larger schools, it would make sense in elementary school to divide the kids by age. So let's say you have enough students in the school to constitute three Grade 1 classes. Instead of just mixing them randomly, why not have one class with kids born in the months September to December, and then the other class with kids born in January to April, and so on? I think that would be a lot better, because there would be no more than a 4-month age difference between classmates, and it improves the odds of all of the kids in that class being roughly at the same stage, which allows the teacher to really focus her efforts. &#10;Something like that might help reduce the number of people holding their kids back."/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1626" language="en" documentId="5039" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Krista" date="03/19/2012" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://www.circleofmoms.com/debating-mums/redshirting-for-kindergarten-688687" topic="redshirting" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="5039" notes="" title="Redshirting for Kindergarten?"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="726"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="727" end="1542"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="1543" end="1626"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47"/></xmi:XMI>
