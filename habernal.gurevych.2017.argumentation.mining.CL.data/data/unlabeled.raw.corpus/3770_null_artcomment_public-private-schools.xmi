But we did send our daughter to private school.  We found that the level of respect REQUIRED by the school made such a difference in the way the school was run.  They did not put up with apathy on the part of the student or the parents.  We were required - yes, required - to sit in at least one classroom session every quarter.  Unannounced to the school or the teacher.  Just check in at the office and sit in.  This forced the teachers to be very accountable to the students and the paying parents.  We were also required to attend parenting meetings every time there was one.  We had to sign in. If we failed to comply, our daughter would have been dismissed from the school.   So, parent involvement was a plus, in our book.  She attended public school until fifth grade.  I was involved in PTA as an officer, we attended every school function, we made sure she was getting her work done.  We were hands on.  Yet, every time I walked through the hallways during the daytime I heard chaos in the classrooms.  I heard teachers shouting and yelling.  It was not a great environment for learning to say the least.   We didn't live in a large city and the schools she attended were not scary or dark or crime filled.  We were in a small town in Texas.  Where everyone knows everyone.  The classes were not overcrowded.  Yet, we felt it was not the best place for her to learn.   So, when we decided to put her in private school we actually moved to the town where her school was.  There was no private school in the town where we lived.  And we have been paying school taxes here ever since.  She is now married and has two kids of her own.  So, by us paying school taxes I would say we are still invested in the public school system - even though we didn't use their services.
