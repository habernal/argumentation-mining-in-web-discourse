Virginia offers two choices: one is a religious exemption and the other option requires that students take standardized tests and prove adequate yearly progress. &#10;The Post should have let us know how many Virginia homeschooling students provide proof of learning and how many take the religious exemption. It would also be great to know of the percent that provide these proofs, what are their scores? I would imagine that they are quite high, based on my own experience. &#10;I personally know probably a hundred homeschooling families who take the tests. I have administered the Stanford tests in my area for several years at all grade levels. The kids in my area do extremely well on these. &#10;I know one family that has trouble with maintaining a good academic environment at home. I think that if they were in public school, that it wouldn't matter much. Their parents really seem like granola-crunch types who want to live off the land or something. But even their kids manage to pass the tests and don't take the religious exemption. &#10;My own girls, since they started homeschooling, have scored in the 95% percentile on standardized tests. Their reading Lexile scores are at the junior college level, and they're 11 and 12. My 11-year-old answered every science question correctly and my 12-year-old answered every math procedure question correctly. And it's not like we try all that hard to have super long school days -- they get to have quite a bit of free time, too, but it hasn't seemed to hurt them. We are signed up wtih a co-op that gives us all kinds of support, but most of our core is done at home. &#10;It seems fairly ridiculous to take one hard case and make a generalization about it. I could certainly find one public schooled student and do the same.
