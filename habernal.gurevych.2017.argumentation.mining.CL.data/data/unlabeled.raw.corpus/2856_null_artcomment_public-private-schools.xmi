I, myself, being a product of a private school education. I would like to correct the author, however. NOT everyone who goes to private school come from rich,  priveleged backgrounds. My mother had to scrimp and save every penny to pay for my tuition fee and I had to forego some of the &quot;toys&quot; that kids my age took for granted but I am grateful for my education. When my daughter started school, I took one look at the public schools in my neighborhood and knew her intelligence would deteriorate with her attending there. I calculated what it would take to pay for before and after daycare and clothes and it basically costed the same to send her to private school. AND she, like me, had to forego the Nintendo DS and the other &quot;toys&quot; that kids took for granted. My daughter passed the SATs at age 12 BECAUSE of a private school education. She had good moral values and thought &quot;shut up&quot; was a bad word. Sadly, ther came a time when I could no longer afford to send her. One year into public school and her morals detriorated because of the stuff she picked up from her classmates. I was in shock! I try hard to support her but I will just say the environment really affects the child. So, please, it does not make a bad parent to send a child to private school!
