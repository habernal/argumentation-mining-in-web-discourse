It often consists of groups of people working together and exchanging ideas and information. The stereotype of homeschoolers as religious nuts who want to cosset their kids away from the world is inaccurate. Many simply disagree with the current thinking on how education should be done and what it is for. &#10;Together with that, many children who do go to school don't really benefit from the diversity people claim they present. Plenty of schools are monoethnic, private schools are very narrow, and even the experience of diversity may backfire and result in prejudice rather than acceptance; many multicultural school communities have racial or social cliques which hate and despise other groups in the school. &#10;And as for influence other than the parents - there is no guarantee that the influence children are under at school is beneficial. Certainly what I experienced at school was largely negative - consisting of being held back, being actively discouraged from trying to achieve, having inconsistent and mixed messages about right and wrong, etc., etc. And at high school I got the distinct impression that many of the staff actually hated the students; they were always angry, always had a look of disgust on their faces, always used dismissive language, and always produced a negative response when any child attempted to do anything different, original or creative. &#10;Storybud&#10;Yes, children learn things from each other at school. How to bully. Prejudice. Racism. Sexism. How to manipulate. How to ostracize. That conformity is more important than self respect. That fitting in to gender stereotypes is more important than making the most of your life. That achievement is something to be hidden and to be ashamed of. &#10;There is absolutely no reason to assume that being in a fairly chaotic environment of 30 children of the same age is beneficial to social or psychological development. It's not a natural situation to be in. It's a system which was deemed useful by 19th century educators intent on applying industrial principles to learning. When it was devised, mass enlightenment was the last thing on anybody's mind. Behind the 1870 Education Act was an openly stated desire to silence dissent and shove the lower orders into line.
