They put up brightly colored posters featuring clowns and animals and titled it &quot;Uncle Ron's Kiddie Crusade&quot;. There were cartoons, magic shows and a clown...quite entertaining. Towards the end of the show, 'Uncle Ron' started speaking about how being saved was a very important thing to do. He went on explaining how to go about this procedure. At the end, he suggested that the only way kids that were not Baptist were going to be saved was to go home and tell our parents how much we enjoyed going to that church and try to convince them to join, otherwise, he could not guarantee that Jesus would accept us into the flock like all the other kids. At that very moment, I realized what was happening. I realized that this guy was hired to brainwash us. From the tender young age of 8, I figured out that religion was just a scam. All they wanted was my families 'offerings' in the collection plate. By using the fear factor (you won't get accepted into heaven, but your friends will) everything I had ever been told in Church started to unravel. I started to question all the contradictions the minister told us at our church. It seemed God loves you, but will cast you into a lake of fire if he felt like it...didn't make much sense to me. The devil was lurking everywhere, yet God who was more powerful than the devil couldn't just wave a magic wand and get rid of him? After all, if God was all powerful the greatest of the great...that should be an easy task, right? My point is, children are highly susceptible to suggestion. Religion knows that. By letting religion into schools is very very dangerous mindset. That school board should be fired.
