(Those who don’t believe me can consult the OECD.) &#10;Some think the Gonski plan will fix this. It will not. It will entrench it because it forces all those schools on Labor’s socially just education resources index onto the Coalition’s socially unjust socio-economic status model. It is John Howard’s final triumph in education funding. All the panel had to do to fool the media was relabel the SES model as “capacity to contribute”. &#10;Prior to 2000, private schools received government funding in proportion to the their private resources. A low-fee school was given more support than a high-fee one. &#10;In 2000, the Howard government changed this. School fees no longer had any effect on government support. The SES level of the students’ neighbours decided the level of support. A school that drew students from a poor area would get more support than one that drew students from a well-off area. This SES model punished low-fee private schools in middle class areas, the schools that had kept their fees low so that just about everyone could attend them. Thus almost half the private schools are still funded on Labor’s ERI model. &#10;The Gonksi model is guaranteed to socially stratify our schools because it says the more you earn the less your child gets. Thus, the wealthy, the middle and the poor all have to concentrate in their own schools because the funding system segregates them. A school that wants to take both middle class and poor students will not be able to because the presence of middle class students will cut its government funding and thus push its fees up and thus drive out the poor, who will end up at the public school.
