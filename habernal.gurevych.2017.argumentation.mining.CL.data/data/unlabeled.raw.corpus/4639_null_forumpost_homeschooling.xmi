With the fees that schools request for materials, books, music, art, field trips and sports, etc. parents are asked to shoulder the costs that public schools absorbed in times past. So, a *free* public education that our state guarantees is a bit of a misnomer these days. It’s more like a public/private education endeavor. &#10;Fortunately, we have been in a position to pay these extra costs for our kids, but I do think about the families that struggle to put food on the table or who make minimum wage. Being asked to *donate* $3,000, so your high schooler can pay football or *donate* $4,000 so your daughter can be a cheerleader is simply cost prohibitive. At my kids’ elementary school which was deemed a “technology school”, students were asked to bring laptops to school starting in 3rd grade. At the time, the requirement was an Apple Macbook that cost about $1,500.00. DH and I did not support the program as we thought it was idiotic for a 3rd grader to bring a device that expensive to school and thought there was value in putting pen to paper, so our kids never participated in this program which fortunately ended after 5th grade (and yes, lots of these laptops were lost, damaged or stolen over these years.) But many parents felt a lot or pressure to participate and be part of the haves and did participate (80% participation rate). &#10;Take also for instance driver’s education. It used to be part of the 10th grade curriculum in my state. I learned how to drive in driver’s education. My parents’ biggest involvement was taking me to the DMV on my 16th bday to get my license. Today, in my county at least, there is no driver's ed course in high school. DH and I spent hours last year teaching ODD how to drive. As part of the license requirement, we also had to hire a private driving instructor and enroll ODD in a driver’s ed course. The cost for both run between $750 on the cheap end and $2,500 on the high end. ODD has friends that do not have their licenses, because their families cannot afford the training. Instead, these kids wait until their 18th bday when there are no requirements to get a license, or they just drive without licenses (a growing trend in our state). &#10;We can get into a whole other discussion about entitlement. These are your kids. You decided to have them. You pay for them. The public doesn’t owe your kid a driver's education or perks above a basic education. I get that. But, I wanted to point out how public schooling has changed over the years and the costs that parents now shoulder that was absorbed in years past. &#10;And from my personal standpoint, it just gets more and more expensive the older the kids get until hopefully the costs peak then fall dramatically upon college or post college graduation.
