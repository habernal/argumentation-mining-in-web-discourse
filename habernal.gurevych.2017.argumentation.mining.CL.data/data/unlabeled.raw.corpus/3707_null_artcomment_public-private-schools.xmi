The writer seems to think that the solution is parental involvement.  It IS a very important component, but difficult to achieve. There are parents that don't want to be involved in the education process, (and you probably don't want them involved anyway) and then parents that want to be but can't.  I wanted to be involved but the school district that my children attended held a lot of their meetings and functions during the day when most parents were working.  I couldn't financially afford to miss work and other parents couldn't either.  But then the school staff, PTA, and other parents on committees would complain about lack of parental involvement! Seriously? Then you have the teachers union that protect the inadequate teachers.  You know the one's who teach for three reasons, June, July and August.  On the other end of the spectrum are the good teachers that have to take time out of their class time to teach hygiene and moral behavior, which should be taught at home. I also don't believe that ALL of our children need a college education.  The cost of a college degree is heinous and there's too many people that can't get a job in their area of study. They settle for a lower paying job, but still have all of those student loans to pay back. Schools were created to educate our children so they would be prepared to enter the workforce. As an employer I see their failure to do even that task. Where do you start? Public schools were created to prepare our children to enter the workforce and as an employer they're failing there also. So where do you start?
