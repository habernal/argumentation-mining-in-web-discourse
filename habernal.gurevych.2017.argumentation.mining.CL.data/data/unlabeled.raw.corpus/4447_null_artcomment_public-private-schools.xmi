Parents who are of the opinion that sending their kids to a private school makes them better parents, and who act on this laughable myth are making a private decision; not one for which the government is responsible or one which the tax payer should fund. Private school parents have every right to send their kids to a state school. The converse is not necessarily so. Yet we all are paying for them. Private schools are no one's responsibility but the parents who elect to use them. Government funding to private schools is at the expense of needed facilities in state schools. These facts bring into question the motives behind the continued waste on private schools. Is it 'old school tie' corruption? Is it fear on behalf of government members that private school parents will vote against them? &#10;sorry James, but you have it all wrong.....by sending my kids to a private school, I am freeing up resources in a state school....the funding model just shifts the money to their private school, and i pay extra on top of that ( private fees) .....i am happy to pay the extra, I went to &quot;Bogan High&quot; which many of you would be shocked to know was a very famous selective high school,I hated it, was bullied, etc...one of my kids got a spot there, which we rejected in favor of a school with better resources, discipline, sport...i make no apologies for this, as i truly missed out...eg no maths teacher for 6 weeks in yr 12, shared text books etc. "/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1562" language="en" documentId="4447" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="James" date="September 04, 2013, 8:06AM" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://www.theage.com.au/comment/private-schools-and-the-art-of-ripping-off-parents-20130903-2t357.html" topic="public-private-schools" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="4447" notes="" title="Private schools and the art of ripping off parents"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="914"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="915" end="1562"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43"/></xmi:XMI>
