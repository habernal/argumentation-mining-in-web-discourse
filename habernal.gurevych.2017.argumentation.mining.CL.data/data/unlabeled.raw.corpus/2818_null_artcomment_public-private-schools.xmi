I went to a public school and was not taught how to think for myself. Not until going to trade school was I taught to EXAMINE for myself what is being taught. How does A affect everything down to Z. Is the instructor teaching the truth or something else? Look up the information and find out for yourself, do the work. The public schools are not teaching our kids to think for themselves. The public schools are teaching our kids to accept what the teacher says as fact without doing their own research. Even the college courses I've had wanted you to accept what was being taught instead of doing your own research.   I eventually worked for a company that sold school material to public, private and homeschool kids. They all took the same standardized tests. The private and homeschool kids came out with much higher scores than those of the public schools. The private and homeschool kids weren't just taught two plus two is four, they were taught why. In other word, how to think and reason.   Our public schools have been failing for over 40 years. There has been more indoctrination than real teaching. My kids have gone to both, I know teachers from both, and it's getting worse on the public level.   Since our president and most of congress send their kids to private school, does that make them bad parents as well?
