Truly, including superior students in a poor educational setting may increase the quality of the education provided there, but at the cost of the education that the superior student will get.  In gifted education, we have faced the same situation -- keep the gifted students in regular or struggling classes so that their influence will enhance the quality of the class.  Unfortunately, the practice of &quot;reverse mainstreaming&quot; extracts a price from the gifted students. As a teacher of science, special education, and gifted education for many years, I have seen the quality of public education be eroded over the years in many schools.  My own teaching efficiency has been compromised by having classrooms half-filled with students who have little interest in education, very little natural curiosity, a complete lack of a sense of propriety for their actions, little or no study skills, etc.  My classes have been successful in a particular sense, but are lower in quality by a significant measure as compared to those I taught some time ago.  As most of my classes were a mixture of high to low ability students, I can guarantee that the higher ability students, despite my attempts to provide for their needs, did not get the same quality of education that they would have received if they were in a setting where I could have taught without the time spent dealing with endlessly disruptive students, students who simply would not make an effort to study or do their assignments, and other distractions -- testing, etc.   If we simply replace the term &quot;higher ability student&quot; with &quot;good, interested, disciplined student&quot;  the advantage of placing them in an educational setting without the distracting factors should be intuitive obvious -- the teachers can teach with more depth and breadth, and the students can develop study skills, proper social interactions, and an understanding of subject matter that is appropriate in depth and breadth.   Parents who evaluate the local school situation to be less than desirable have a responsibility to place their children in the best possible educational situation that they can.   It is the responsibility of the educational administrators to strengthen the educational program, not the parents at the cost to their children.  If the administrators and board members do this, then the parents who wish for the best for their children will consider placing their children in the public system rather than a costly private school.   Ms. Benedikt has the sequence of actions backward.  The &quot;bad&quot; parents are those who do not take the time to provide their children with the educational tools and direction that will make them builders of the pubic schools rather than detrimental to the educational efforts of their teachers and other students.
