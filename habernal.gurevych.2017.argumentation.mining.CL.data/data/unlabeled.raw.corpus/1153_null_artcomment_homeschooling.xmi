It's about control too. Cocooning one's children in order to isolate them from an environment in which parents are demoted from power.&quot; &#10;__________________&#10;My sole motivation when chosing home ed was to provide him with an education.&#10;He left school last year with a global grade of 6 (weak pass). He had his annual exams at his former school on Monday. He was awarded a global grade of 10 (the highest mark possible). Our choice to home ed is all about learning. &#10;He was more &quot;cocooned&quot; at school.&#10;The heavy homework load meant afterschool activities, both organized and free-play were severely curtailed out of necessity. &#10;In a single week his class had at least 3/4 of &quot;playtimes&quot; were withdrawn to punish the class for the minor infractions of a single pupil. Any form of interaction between peers in the classroom was frowned upon and was the fastest to way to having even fewer break times. &#10;During his last academic year at school he had time for one sport and no more than one &quot;playdate&quot; per week. Both were subject to cancellations due to regular homework avalanches. &#10;This year he has participated in two teams sports, one individual sport, oratorio (a sort of youth club, 300 kids, most attending his former school) and daily meet ups for free play with not only his mates from his old class, but also the new friends he has made via his activities and clubs. He interacts with large and small groups of other children every single day for several hours. I am only present in his social life if it is my turn to have a band of small boys charging around the house. His father does all the dropping off and picking up and doesn’t hang around to supervise when other adults are in charge. &#10;Control matters to me. I exercised it when I chose the first local school, when I changed to another local school, when I tried to create change from within the second local school, when I looked into private education, when I considered (and rejected) moving back to the UK, when I plumped for home ed as the best option when all factors were taken into consideration. &#10;In that sense control/power matters to me because I am a parent rather than because I am a home educator. That places me well inside the mainstream rather than on the outskirts as an oddity. &#10;Control does not matter to me in terms of placing limits on his exposure to wide range of people, values and philosophies. &#10;I am an atheist, he goes to summer camp and the youth club at the local church, goes to his friends’ religious based parties and celebrations, attends church occasionally when it is a big local event and I had him baptized as a Catholic to avoid traumatizing his Nonna. &#10;His friends, acquaintances and team mates come from a huge range of backgrounds, cover most of the continents in terms of origin, are often the product of very different parenting practices to my own and range from seriously rich to significantly deprived. &#10;Far from being an exception, I have found my stance of not seeking to isolate my son from “different people/ideas” mirrored by UK based home educators far more often that it has contrasted. &#10;Via the net I've read, spoken to, exchanged views and argued the toss with more home educators than you can shake a stick at. &#10;I also spent three years hanging around the school gates and still spend a good chunk of my day conversing with parents who send their kids to school. There is so much diversity within both groups that it is impossible to try and assign global motivations, personalities traits or philosophies to either camp based on nothing more than their educational choices.
