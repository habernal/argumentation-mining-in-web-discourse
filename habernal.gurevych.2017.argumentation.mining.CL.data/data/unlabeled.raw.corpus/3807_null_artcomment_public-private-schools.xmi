This is what I think: so people who speak the truth are bad?  because, you know, when someone is forced to pay for services they don't use, that's bad.  And it's unfair.  You argue that society benefits from this public education service.  But society also benefits from the guy who sends his kid to a private school.  And I would argue that society benefits more from the guy who sent his kid to a quality private school than a crappy public school.  If that guy wasn't forced to pay twice, he could invest his money in other smart ways besides sinking it into a system of waste and bureaucracy.  So I would respond to your statement calling people who want to &quot;skip out&quot; as &quot;bad people&quot; as total nonsense.  They are, in fact, really smart people and if they were allowed to &quot;skip out&quot; our society would benefit from it.  People who send their kids to a more expensive private school should be allowed a tax credit up to the amount public school tuition would be.  Ideally, they should get a dollar for dollar credit due to the superior education they purchased for &quot;the society&quot;.  That should strike a pleasant chord with most utopians, eh?
