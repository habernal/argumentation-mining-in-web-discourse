It went into effect January 1, 2006. The bill, an addition to the home education law, reads as follows: &#10;(F.1) (1) Beginning January 1, 2006, the school district of residence shall permit a child who is enrolled in a home education program to participate in any activity that is subject to the provisions of Section 511 including, but not limited to, clubs, musical ensembles, athletics and theatrical productions provided that the child: (I) meets the eligibility criteria, or their equivalent, for participation in the activity that apply to students enrolled in the school district; (II) meets the try-out criteria, or their equivalent, for participation in the activity that apply to students enrolled in the school district; and (III) complies with all policies, rules and regulations, or their equivalent, of the governing organization of the activity. (2) For the purposes of this subsection, the school district of residence's program of interscholastic athletics, including varsity sports, shall be considered an activity and shall include all activities related to competitive sports contests, games, events or exhibitions involving individual students or teams of students whenever such activities occur between schools within the school district or between schools outside of the school district. (3) where the activity requires completion of a physical examination or medical test as a condition of participation and the school district of residence offers such physical examination or medical test to students enrolled in the school district, the school district shall permit a child who is enrolled in a home education program to access such physical examination or medical test. The school district shall publish the dates and times of such physical examination or medical test in a publication of general circulation in the school district and on its publicly accessible internet website. (4) A board of school directors may adopt a policy to implement the requirements of this subsection. Such policy shall only apply to participation in activities and shall not conflict with any provisions of this section. &#10;And here are forms that the school can use to report a homschooled child that is involved in public school activities: &#10;PDE-4083 (.pdf) -- Membership Report for Nonpublic and Home Education Students Attending Public Schools Part-Time A form used by the district to report to the PDE &quot;the membership data for students who are either enrolled in a nonpublic school or in a home education program and are educated part-time by the school district, area vocational-technical school (AVTS)/career technical school or intermediate unit (IU)&quot;. The membership data is used in the calculation of each school district's state funding. See also here and here. &#10;Everything that I'm finding shows that in PA the schools are reimbursed for homeschooled students that participate in public schools. According to the link that I provided yesterday, 22 states have laws in place to allow homeschooled students to participate in public school activities without affecting funding.
