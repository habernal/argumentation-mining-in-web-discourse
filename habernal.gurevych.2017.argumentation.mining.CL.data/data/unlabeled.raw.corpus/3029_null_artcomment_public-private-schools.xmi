Change to an existing system is a herculean task that most working parents cannot undertake in time to benefit their children.  My child attended our local public school for 13 years.  I recall a gym teacher who often stated to his classes that girls didn't need to excel in sports. (We had to wait for a year for his retirement.)  I recall receiving complaints from one teacher for an entire year because my child was completing the in-class math assignments too quickly and was also quietly completing extra math problems without permission.  (I was told by both the teacher and the principal that the classes were taught to the lowest common denominator.)  I recall having to pay for extra-curricular tutors because the school did not have qualified teachers to prepare students for year-end state exams in two courses.  (The principal informed me that it wasn't his job to insure a strong educational environment, he just needed to make sure that he had someone at the front of the classroom.) These are just a few of the many examples of a less than acceptable educational environment; but, we could not afford a better one.  The author should understand that each child has just one chance to progress through a school system and that every concerned parent wants that progression to be the best one possible.
