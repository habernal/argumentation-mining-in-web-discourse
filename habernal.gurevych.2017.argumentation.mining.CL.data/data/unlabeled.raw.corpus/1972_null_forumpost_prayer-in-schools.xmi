You arethere is a god and you arehe wrote 10 rules, 4 or 5 of which pertain to him and 4 or 5 that pertain to how we should live with each other, yet the only evidence we have of them is written in a book, not in stone. You make these assumptions based on words in a book that you say we shouldn't trust. How do you live with this kind of logic? &#10;But again, you are basing this belief what was written in a book. You don't have the stone tablets. You are also interpreting the commandments in a way that ISN&quot;T supported by them. The 10C's do NOT state to not allow other people to get you to do things contrary to them. You are being hypocritical when you interpret because you said earlier that man shouldn't interpret. &#10;See what I mean? This is being hypocritical.&#10;You are correct, the 10C's don't specifically say what the consequences are for not following them. How ever the very same book you base your belief in DOES say what the consequences are. How do you reconcile belief in the commandments based on the book and ignore the rest of the book? &#10;You DO realize that these &quot;rules&quot; were around long before the 10C's were written, right? You also realize that these rules can and should be broken under certain circumstances, right? If my parents were sexually abusive, should I still honor them and not turn them in??? What prevents you from molesting kids? That wasn't one of the 10 rules. Wouldn't you agree that you don't do a lot of things because you have a conscience that prevents you from doing them? Don't you find it odd that this god doesn't want you coveting your neighbors possessions, yet doesn't say a damn thing about molesting children? &#10;What information is available to you? The book you say we shouldn't trust? You've repeated this rant in 3 or 4 different threads now, is this your only argument for all things religious? If so it's failing miserably. &#10;You're copying and pasting this same rant with few minor changes to fit the thread you;re in, of course you know what you are repeating. The 10C's do NOT say that no one should not speak for god, this is your own poor interpretation. Stop being hypocritical.
