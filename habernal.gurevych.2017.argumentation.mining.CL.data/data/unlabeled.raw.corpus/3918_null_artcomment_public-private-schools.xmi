To many dollars are wasted on because of poor administrators, and the quality of our teachers is not very good. Interestingly the majority of teachers in public schools in this country finished in the lower half of their graduating class out of college. Our teachers salaries attract candidates at the lower end of the scale because high performers are not interested in teaching when they can go to the private sector and earn more money. Of course I will get bashed for saying this but the teachers unions and their support of mediocrity are a big component in this equation. I would rather have better qualified teachers earning more money and being held accountable for their performance like in most businesses. The administration in our public schools is also a big reason we can't pay our teachers better and improve our public schools. I don't understand how a teaching certificate or a PHD in literature provides qualifications for someone to run a business. Schools are businesses with budgets, payrolls, utility expenses, and capitol spending. I have been to many a school board meeting and have walked away thinking these people wouldn't last five minutes in the real world. Let's run our schools as businesses and have people with business acumen and backgrounds administer our schools. In many other parts of the world where the structure is like what I am describing public schools statistically blow us out of the water.
