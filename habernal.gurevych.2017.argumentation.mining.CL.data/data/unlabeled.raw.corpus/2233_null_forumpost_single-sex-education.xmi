The all-girls school had a better reputation than my co-ed high school. Did I feel that the education was better at my all-girls school than my co-ed school? Yes. But that was entirely due to the actual school, and not because of the genders of the kids who went to the schools. &#10;I was always a smart kid. My grades were the same. I was still one of the top students, in both schools. I just felt the teachers at my all-girls school were slightly better than the ones at my co-ed school. My education had NOTHING to do with whether or not boys were in the same class as me. I was a &quot;geeky&quot; girl, and none of the boys had a problem with that – in fact, one of the smartest boys in the year liked me . . . as well as one of the &quot;dumbest&quot;, who was my year's &quot;bad boy&quot;. &#10;I don't think boys pressure girls to be dumb. And I really don't think that, if your girls are smart, they will allow boys to &quot;dumb&quot; them down. If they want to be smart, they'll continue to be – it's their drive and passion to achieve something that matters, not what surrounds them.
