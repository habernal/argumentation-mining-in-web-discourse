Prayer was never forced when I went to school, it was a freedom of choice for a child. Did you know that when the first Laws against Prayer in Schools came about, it was all most unchallenged in Court? As for women,a lot of men do not understand how a woman feels and I wish to share a short short, As we advance into the 22nd century, a lot of woman are so connected to the past of a day that the sense of valuer for her is becoming lost and the respect in that concept will be only ancient in origin. Before I share, try to understand that I am of a time and a race of people that have faith in that which has become lost. What we are doing will only be a pin prick against the system, but it will…. Please allow me to show you how deep this issue is within a Matrix {of days of the past} that some do not understand. One must be of a time before the Laws created against God through the prayer in school, and to see what has took place for 30 years because of this Law of no prayer at school,and now look where we are at today. I have watched for over 40 years children die in school and this is not a myth. As a child and to feel protected by God, a myth that some seem to say I need to prove He lives. Because of the diversity between different Faiths, it is important to remember that the goal is to bring back only that 10 second moment of silence, of Prayer. To bring in different Faiths and Bible teachings will only cluster the goal. On page 20 the Pay It Forward Petition is our little views….. All so, Join us in the; “International Boycott Of The Arabic Drug Empire” What does this Boycott have to do with this, nothing and yet, “everything”, drugs, guns and death. When I wrote my first “ Boycott” I just wanted to see the trickle effect it would have, with out stepping into a forth dimension and having my in site lost. To bring Life to hope where there is none in our schools through a Boycott and words of truth.To give a child room for thought, a new directive for in site… The Arabic Drug Empire is the only one in the world that seeks to kill every last man woman and child in the world in order for their chosen few can repopulate the world…. Our goal is for our words to go around the world, to be heard in the streets to the country until it reaches the White House and shakes the very foundation of this Government Institution. It is not what we say that counts in as much as, it is what we do not say that builds words of truth. Some say that a Boycott is a waist of time, but it would depend on what is said and how to merge this Boycott into the Violence At Our Schools, to understand we wish to live and we fight with words of truth to in force our right, because we face inhalation through the miss use of a faith.
