Not a problem! Congratulations &amp; Good Luck to by the way!&#10;Yes, we are on Education action and DS is on the SEN Register. I know that the school are well up on special needs, including autism. It is a little out of the way, in a country village where the class sizes are 12 per year! But considering the class sizes, they have a well above average number of statemented children. (My guess is that other parents who are in a similar situation to me were looking for a small class to begin with, and over time the school have built up a good reputation.) &#10;I know they were very, very keen to get his IEPs done and get him onto school action when we first started and they are very accommodating of his individual needs; BUT he only goes in an afternoon as it's very calm and pretty much free choice all the time so there's limited structure and on one of the days he's got an outreach worker who goes in and works with him so she's pretty much providing one to one on those days. The situation as it is now would be that he doesn't need a one on one at the moment, and from when I last spoke to the SENCo (also nursery manager) she said she see's absolutely no rush to hire a 1:1... Now, I'm pretty sure that if they tried to do more structured things with him they would have an entirely different opinion! But, as they and I both agree, getting him properly settled in and used to the children around him is the first and foremost priority. And I can see a big improvement myself. I always mixed him as I was adamant that he would not be an unsociable little boy just because he was the only oneBackfired! (No, I think I started to realise he had a lot of similarities in the children I knew from the family who have Asperger's and PDD-NOS very early on in his life.) But watching him in pre-school, after such a major regression especially, getting used to being around kids again and even starting to make some eye contact with them is HUGE to me. So I can't fault what they are doing one bit. (So far.) &#10;I just feel it's time to move it on a bit as I think a couple of new targets are needed, and also feel they need to see the &quot;real&quot; DS ... warts and all. But then, they are experienced and I don't want to seem like a know it all mother either. &#10;Half term now, so I think we will have to have a sit down in a few weeks after DS has settled back in. &#10;Did you find out about your son? Or is there another wait?&#10;Thanks for your replies, much appreciated!"/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2464" language="en" documentId="4950" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Jen W(34)" date="01-04-10 00:33" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://www.netmums.com/coffeehouse/netmums-coffeehouse-archives-528/primary-school-admission-appeals-clinic-599/404307-special-educational-needs-re-mainstream-school-all.html" topic="mainstreaming" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="4950" notes="" title="Special Educational Needs re.
