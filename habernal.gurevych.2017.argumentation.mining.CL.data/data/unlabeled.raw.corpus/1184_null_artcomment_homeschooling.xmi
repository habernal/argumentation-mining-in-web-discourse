Sorry if that sounds arrogant. I just feel it is the thin end of a very wide wedge of state interference in private matters. &#10;We do in fact already have legal facility to intervene where it comes to the notice of the LA that a parent's private provision may not be adequate. What we don't have, and I don't advocate, is routine scrutiny of all home education provision just in case an aberration occurs, much as we don't have routine search of private homes in case of receipt of stolen goods, or starving under 5's, or even paedophilia or incest - we have to trust that people are honest and are doing what they are supposed to be doing, unless we have sound reason to suspect otherwise, or we would live in a very sick and hateful society. It might feel easy now to say what does it matter to a few home educators, but if we let that slip, then what or who next? &#10;I think that because we have been so hoodwinked over the last 1.5 centuries into thinking that school is compulsory and exams must be taken and certain subjects are sacrosanct, that we find it hard to grasp the reality that education is a private matter over which parents are sovereign. Yes, causing a child to receive an education is a legal requirement, but how we do it is a private matter. IF we are suspected of not doing it, there is already appropriate legal redress and parents can be forced to cause their child to attend a state school if the LA deem it necessary. Thankfully this is still challengeable in court as are all other legal remdies. &#10;That we agree on :-)&#10;That is because the state owes a duty to the taxpayer and to the users of their services - the private family is not a state service. As in the issue of feeding one's children, the state assumes you take your responsibility seriously and will not cause your child to starve or be undernourished unless it is brought to their notice that a family may be failing a child and state intervention may be necessary (in education or welfare) - in which case they already have powers to act. &#10;I didn't detect sarcasm and am happy to respond. I am afraid that I could direct you to endless government publications that either directly lie or conveniently don't tell the whole truth. In this thread we have already read of one HEing parent who thought they had to submit to annual inspection because that is what govt employees told them - that sort of behaviour is sadly still the rule rather than the exception! Yet it is a LIE and many LA personnel tell it over and over - many don't even know it is a lie. &#10;You may have to &quot;study&quot; certain subjects if you attend a state school (ie the state school must provide them), but you have no obligation to take any exams at all, but the school won't tell you that because that would mess up their league tables. Not that I am advocating bothering to study and not taking the exam - or otherwise - but I am pointing out the subtle and not so subtle ways in which we are misled by the govt we supposedly put there to represent us. &#10;This is the panopticon effect (see wikipedia) - create the illusion that something is there and soon enough people believe it is there and it affects their behaviour. The term &quot;compulsory school age&quot; has been with us since at least 1944 - but school has NEVER been compulsory! &#10;Shoplifting at Woolworths/Boots (can't recall) decreased when cardboard cut-outs of police officers were placed near the doors. &#10;LA's policy documents say &quot; we do a home visit to monitor home education annually&quot; or &quot;all children in X county will be required to take Maths, English and D&amp;T GCSE exams&quot; and they create the illusion that it is a legal requirement. &#10;Hope that's not too much of a rant."/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="3797" language="en" documentId="1184" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Baldtwitlion" date="30 July 2010 6:54pm" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/6911646" topic="homeschooling" thumbsUp="10" thumbsDown="0" origId="1184" notes="" title="Home education: precious, not dangerous"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="13"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="14" end="236"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="237" end="976"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="977" end="1633"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="1634" end="1654"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="1655" end="2139"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="63" sofa="1" begin="2140" end="2655"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="2656" end="3120"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="71" sofa="1" begin="3121" end="3398"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="75" sofa="1" begin="3399" end="3527"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="79" sofa="1" begin="3528" end="3761"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="83" sofa="1" begin="3762" end="3797"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59 63 67 71 75 79 83"/></xmi:XMI>
