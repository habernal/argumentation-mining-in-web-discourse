For example, I'm homeschooled because I'm simply too sick to attend a traditional public school. (I say &quot;traditional&quot; because I technically am in a public school. It's a public charter school with a homeschooling division.) I firmly believe homeschooling is the best choice for me, because I was failing all my classes before I switched to homeschool studies in middle school. Now I'm graduating high-school early with a high GPA. &#10;That all being said, I've seen the darker side of homeschooling. In my opinion, homeschooling because of ideological reasons is extremely harmful to children. My cousins, for example, are homeschooled simply because their family is Christian. Their parents believe that everything--including school--should revolve around their religion. My teenaged cousins are more sheltered than most seven-year-olds. They honestly don't understand that the modern world doesn't revolve around their religion. They believe that everyone who isn't Christian is either evil or a terrible influence. I'm sure you can see how this will lead to some major issues when they hit eighteen and are struck full-force with reality. &#10;And my cousins aren't the only ones. Probably about 70% of the students in my homeschooling academy are there because of religious reasons. There is a painfully obvious lack of maturity and real-world education in this 70%. All you have to do is talk to them for three minutes to see that they're not only immature and uneducated, but have been deluded into thinking they're more mature and educated because they have faith and others don't. &#10;In all honesty, I think public schooling is best for most kids. It provides real-world experience that homeschooling simply can't give a student. It exposes them to various opinions and beliefs, which I think is critical to a true education. Plus, it allows them to gain social skills, in both the best and worst of situations. &#10;That being said, I think it all comes down to the individual student. If there is a good reason for them to homeschool, then homeschooling may be the best option. But, if a student is homeschooling because of ideological reasons, I think it can become extremely harmful. To put it simply: I think public schooling is usually the best option, but as with everything, there will always be exceptions. &#10;"/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2448" language="en" documentId="440" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Olivia45" date="October 28, 2013 10:47" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://nanowrimo.org/forums/age-group-teens/threads/128227?page=6" topic="homeschooling" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="440" notes="" title="Homeschooling - debate"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="567"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="568" end="1275"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="1276" end="1718"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="1719" end="2047"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="2048" end="2447"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="2448" end="2448"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59"/></xmi:XMI>
