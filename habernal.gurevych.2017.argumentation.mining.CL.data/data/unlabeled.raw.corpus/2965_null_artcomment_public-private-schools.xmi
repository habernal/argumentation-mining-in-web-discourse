Sorry, I'm not compelled in the least.  Irritated at the gross ignorance and poorly written assumptions, most definitely.  The counter argument is quite simple really.  My children need what my children need.  As their father and my wife as their mother are close enough to know what they need.  Some random person that has never met them has no clue.  Assumptions based on statistical averaging that are then used for decision making results in mediocre performance at best when compared to detailed evaluation of the situation along with constant feedback.  In other words, the one size fits all formula hardly fits anyone very well. Now as far as fixing the public education system, if this is my goal then I work towards this goal regardless of where my children are called to attend (according to THEIR needs not your desires).  I should not on the other-hand be compelled to support a failing school system through the coercion tactics that are suggested by the writer.  I should not be compelled to fix a failing school system because my children are in it.  Instead I should be free to find alternatives.  This is especially true when schools today are pushing values that conflict with our world view and even flat out lie in order to push these same values.  My children first need education from their schooling not indoctrination. Finally, your thing is your thing and mine is mine.  Each of us are naturally drawn to improve some area of our world.  For each of us this may be different.  Mine happens to be rehabilitating our lost to live well in our world.  (Prison ministries)  Being naturally drawn to this calling I feel everyone should as well, but I'm not ignorant and know that we need people focusing on their own callings and not mine. Again this argument for everyone going to public school is not compelling.  The language used shows a great lack of understanding.  And the arguments are week and merely are designed to evoke emotion in the non-discerning.
