They did not impose their beliefs on anyone else. After doing this for a few days, a teacher noticed and alerted the principal. All were suspended for 3 days and my niece’s mother was told to keep her daughter home until she understood that she was NOT ALLOWED to pray at school. Being only 10 years old, she did not understand what she did WRONG. &#10;I remember saying The Lord’s Prayer every morning after The Pledge of Allegiance. I remember feeling safe and unified. We, all of us together, were a ONE. I remember when prayer stopped. I no longer felt that oneness. &#10;I thoroughly believe taking prayer out of the schools began our moral decay. Not all parents take their children to church, but they celebrate Christmas and Easter. In this day and age of both parents working and everything moving so fast, Sunday has become a much looked forward to day to sleep in. Saturday is not just enough anymore. &#10;We need prayer back in school. Not just a “moment of silence.” We need prayer spoken out loud, all together. If anyone is not Christian, then they should sit quietly and be respectful. If there are children of any other religion, then they should be allowed to have the same time to worship. &#10;This country was founded with God’s blessings. We are “One Nation Under God.” If people don’t like it, they have the choice to live somewhere else.
