She seems to ignore a glaring reality, namely that parents often send their children to private school, at great sacrifice, because a sizable number of the students at their public school behave like sociopaths.  They behave this way precisely because they are lacking socialization as a result of  their caretakers completely abdicating responsibility.  Good, caring, diligent teachers in these schools, and there are many, want out because they can't make a difference, and, sadly, typically get no support from administration.  These are generalizations but nonetheless accurate. Many of our schools are like absolute zoo's.  We talk about them being decrepit or somehow inadequate when compared to most schools around the world they are filled with amenities and comforts that would be the envy of all students.  Ironically, in these other countries real learning takes place and a culture of respect permeates the way the students and adults interact with each other.  You can see that in Finland, Denmark, South Korea, Kenya, and so forth.  What takes place in thousands of high schools in America would be unfathomable in most parts of the world.  Think about that! The administration in these &quot;crappy&quot; school are also in an untenable position - they are basically being asked to make up for all of the deficiencies of the caretakers (parents, grandmothers, etc.) and somehow fill the void that a life of deprivation, violence and general degradation has produced. It is impossible to do so. The administration in these schools are scared, scared of confronting sociopaths and potentially losing their jobs, being labeled one thing or the other, or finding themselves in the same position as their own teachers, that is, alone with no support. So the inmates run the asylum.   Doesn't Benedikt have it wrong? Shouldn't we perhaps do something about the 10-20% of sociopathic kids in these schools wreaking havoc on the unfortunate kids who have to go there while driving countless others into private schools. Wouldn't that make more sense?  Then you would really find out if the school was truly crappy and any teacher or administrator clearly identified as lacking could be removed.  You'd be left with schools that caring, capable parents would be happy to send their kids to.  No self-respecting parent will willfully put their child into an environment of danger and mayhem, particularly when it is obvious that the adults at the school have no ability to change it or protect their children. That would be criminal  and negligent.
