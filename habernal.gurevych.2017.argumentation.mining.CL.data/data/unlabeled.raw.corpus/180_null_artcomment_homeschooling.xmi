For purposes of this subdivision, 'bona fide religious training or belie' does not include essentially political, sociological or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code.&quot; &#10;This case is an abdication of the local school administrator. The pupil clearly was not conscientiously opposed to attendence at school, and for the officials to say that they have a difficult time interpreting that is a cop-out. It is crystal clear. &#10;The RE statute isn't a homeschooling statute at all. It is completely separate from the Virginia home education statute and governs the exemption from public school of those who are opposed for religious reasons. It is accurate to say that a family is opting out of school under the RE statute, not that they are homeschooling under the statute, since the RE statute has nothing to do with homeschooling. &#10;Virginia homeschooling laws are reasonable and require proof of progress. The RE law does not because IT IS NOT A HOMESCHOOLING LAW. &#10;And for those people making comments saying that parents cannot possibly educate their children in high school, please understand that homeschooling is not synonomous with teaching. It means that a parent is responsible for directing their child(ren)'s education, not that they will teach every subject. &#10;It is not unusual for homeschoolers to graduate college 1-2 years early because they were able to start early. My daughter graduated from high school with her freshman year in college completed (Dean's List both semesters). I'm not a high school teacher, but I am a parent capable of finding effective resources and people to teach my homeschooled children. Teaching degrees are mostly about classroom management, not content (or so say the teachers that I know), which is irrelevant to homeschoolers.
