My Dad taught us maths, science, technology etc, while my Mum taught us humanities, English etc.home (generally). However, we would also tend to spend time on various other non-school-like subjects as well as learning more day-today stuff that seems to pass many by, like how to do a household budget, cooking and the like (I know many who make it through school without ever learning how to cook or budget properly). We also had links to other home-schooled children and spent time with them, as well as occasionally joining up for various group activities. We went to a weekly after-school youth group (Woodcraft Folk, for those who know). We would spend much of our lesson time in the summer outside, either with books or just learning about nature or going on trips. Possibly the biggest obstacle was funding - we lost out BIG time when BCCI went bust and my Dad only worked sporadically after, though we qualified for the occasional grant for materials. &#10;When I got to GCSE age I went back to school (since it cost much to enter exams independently) and hated it. I was not used to such cruelty or trying to learn in an environment where most people do not want to learn. I found religious assemblies objectionable. However, despite huge problems I had with bullying and absence due to this I found my home education allowed me to breeze through subjects, even where I had missed sections of the curriculum and had to learn from scratch. This is because I was taught not just facts, but how to learn and think for myself. I feel very fortunate to have had such able parents. &#10;Of course the flip side of this is that I have met home-schooled people who's parent's idea of schooling is to let them do what they like and to have no lessons at all. They have tended to have large gaps in their general knowledge, but often excel in other areas (usually art, performance or sport). Of course, I meet a great many people who have made it through the state school system with exactly the same problems - people who can do little maths, practically never read and who have no knowledge/interest in current affairs. &#10;I guess my point is; it is so reliant on individuals - individual schools, individual teachers, individual parents, individual children - that you cannot really make broad generalisations. What I do know is this; it is MUCH more important that parents take an active role in the education of their children and encourage them to be curious, inquisitive and thoughtful than anything else. I child that is endowed with these attributes will undoubtedly do well in whatever path they choose and it seems that when a parent hands over the education of their child to a school they seem to feel that this is where their own obligations end. Whereas, when a parent chooses home-schooling it is often the case that they are taking this responsibility on board. Not always, as with religious reasons, but often.
