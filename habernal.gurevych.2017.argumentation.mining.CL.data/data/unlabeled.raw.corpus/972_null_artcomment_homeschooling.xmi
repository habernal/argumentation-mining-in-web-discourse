That's what the state does to your children, the ones you send to school. &#10;Point one It is not home school it is home education&#10;Point two. It is the parents legal responsibility to ensure their child receives an education not the government's. Your child leaves school at 16 unable to read and write it is your fault not the government's. This after they have been in &quot;school&quot; for 11 years. &#10;As for the socialisation issue, those that don't home educate have no idea. Our family is unable to take part in all the home education group activities as there are so many of them. &#10;It was funny this afternoon watching the schooled children staggering out of school into the arms of their &quot;loving&quot; parents, desperate for some freedom, as our group of circa 25 families with children aged 1-14, had been exploring in the forest before returning to base (opposite the school exit) at 3:30pm to then set up various activities for the children indoors. This includes a book club where the children stand up in front of their peers and describe their favorite book. No pressure, no coercion. They do it because they want to; it was suggested and the children wanted to do it. This session is led by a 6 year old, and today's participants ranged from 5 years old to 12 years old. Others couldn't be bothered, they were too busy climbing trees. Others were doing painting, others being read stories. &#10;As for Rainbows, Brownies, Beavers, Cubs, Scouts, Badgers, gymnastics, etc, etc. my children are locked away NOT. Their lives, knowledge, confidence and many other aspects of their existence have been vastly enriched by being home educated, not state schooled.
