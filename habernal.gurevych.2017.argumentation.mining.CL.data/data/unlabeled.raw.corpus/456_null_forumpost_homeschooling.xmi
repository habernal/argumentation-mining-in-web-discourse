For her, since she's more of a social butterfly, it was kind of lonely at first. She wanted to go back into school the next year, but then we moved, which complicated things for her. We spent another year in homeschooling, joining co-ops and making other homeschooling friends, and after that, my sister and I never wanted to go back to public school again. We loved having the freedom of focusing on the subjects that interested us and getting to read our school books in our pajamas. It is true that there are a few things that we missed. I missed my tennis classes and some my friends and she missed her dance classes and ALL of her friends, but when we made friends at our co-op, we realized something. The people that we socialized with in school were all just about the same age. The people that we socialized with outside of public school were mostly older than us. The older students helped us mature faster, and we helped the younger students mature faster. This helped us to be better equipped to socialize with children and old people, and everyone in between. :) &#10;Now, my sister--who is supposed to be a senior in high school--is in her freshman year in college with the President's scholarship and a high SAT score. She is studying alongside homeschoolers and public schoolers alike, and is getting mostly A's. She is doing just as well, if not better, than some of her older public schooled friends. For us, homeschooling gave us a life to live and choices to make, rather than the everyday blah of public school. Even though my mom was a single mom with not much time to give us and not much money to spend on our books, we still made things work. Of course, homeschooling is not for everyone, but my sister and I had a wonderful experience with it. I suppose it just depends on the person. &#10;In any case, good luck to all with your school work, and I wish you the best of luck with your schooling choices.
