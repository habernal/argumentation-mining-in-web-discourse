Their methods are to demonize those that either have the disposable income or make the hard sacrifice to send their kids to a private school. Allison Benedikt  lost me when the &quot;bad person&quot; comment was made. We have had some recent comments from politicians that make similar statements about income. If you make over a certain amount you are making too much and should be punished for reaching those goals. People that send their children to private school still support public education through the taxes they pay so it's not a matter of funding. The money many public schools get is based on the number of students enrolled and sit in the classrooms. But that is a different matter based on the laws in each state and school district which is controlled by politicians and the government on both the state and federal level. Most of the problems are based on politics and government waste. A lot of that waste is the fault of the administration. A lot of it is based on the mandates of the federal and state government. Basic education is being lost as the new ideas come down and are more politicized. Teachers are having their hands tied on how they teach and what they teach. The kids that get the most attention are the ones that somehow excel at something or the ones that are the trouble makers. The vast majority just seem to skim through the system basically unnoticed as long as they just get by. I live in a school district that has a very good elementary school system but a really bad middle school program that is way overcrowded. They build a lot of elementary and high schools but the middle schools are lacking and crowded with 3-4 kids sharing a locker. So, I decided to make the sacrifice to send my kid to private schools from 7th grade on. He was just an average kid and the rigors of a school where every teacher, coach, and administrator knew his name he was not able to just get by. They challenged him. Encouraged him. Made him take responsibility for his actions both good and bad. By the time he was a senior he had become a captain of the baseball team and surprised me so much because at some of the school functions he had grown into a good public speaker. He still wasn't the best student, about average, but I could see the character development that would have been lost in a fair to poor public school system. For several years my son and his noncustodial mother would say he was missing out by going to private schools. But as he went to college and made observations of other students he could tell that the education he got from the Catholic schools made him better prepared to handle life at college and just life in general. He actually thanked me a couple of years ago. He graduated from one college and went on to recently graduate from Loyola law school in New Orleans and was accepted at Georgetown to get his masters. I shudder to think what he would have settled for in life if he had gone to a public school. I'm sure he would have made it in some way but he seems to have gone further than I have ever dreamed so I have no regrets in sending him to a college prep private high school. If I have some how made my child a better person by making this sacrifice then I have done more for the system than putting him through the ordeal of a private school as opposed to being lock stepped with a system that moves at the whim of the political powers.
