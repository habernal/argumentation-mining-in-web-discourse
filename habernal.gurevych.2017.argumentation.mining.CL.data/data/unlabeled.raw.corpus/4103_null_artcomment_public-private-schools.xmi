I volunteered at the school and was truly disgusted to see bright kids in a classroom along with kids who couldn't even read. I found the answer. I was so annoyed with the snail's pace of learning in the classroom wherein they have to wait for the slowest kid to get the concept that I moved them to several on-line classes free through the Florida Virtual School. The information they teach is in line with the in-classroom courses but the kids go at their own pace...FAST and all-year-round if they want to! You wouldn't believe how much more kids can learn when they are not bored, distracted by other kids, or giving in to peer pressure to act stupid. Both my kids in elementary and middle have moved ahead by a whole extra grade level in the past 2 years. I would imagine at this pace they will both graduate from high school 2 years early and still have more classes completed and an Associates Degree at the same time. Some of these classes they do at school, some at home and they have to take all the same standardized tests. Both always get straight As in Advanced level coursework so I would argue that the quality is not lacking in the schools or their material, but how it is being delivered. I see there is a serious lack of quality is in the lazy students and their parents in the classroom, but why they refuse to put advanced and hardworking kids in one spot and the lazy and remedial in another is beyond me.  The private school still only put them in a grade based on their age NOT on their ability or knowledge level. THIS is where the problem lies. Remove the archaic barriers and evolve!
