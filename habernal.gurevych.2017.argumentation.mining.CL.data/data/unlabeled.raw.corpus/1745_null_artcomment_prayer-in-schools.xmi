School age children face so many problems and trials and if they are of a Christian faith, they need God’s guidance and protection. Yes, we can all pray at home, but the Bible even says “where two or three are gathered in my name, there will I be also”. If, let’s say 70% of the students are Christian and they all are given time to pray during the school day, on campus, God can move so much for those students and teachers. I also do not feel that prohibiting teachers from being involved in the religious meetings is right. I am studying to be a teacher and I am also a Christian, and I do not see, if there is a student led religious meeting on campus, why I would not be allowed to participate. Or even better, why could I not lead a religious meeting, bible study, etc, on campus, after hours? The removal of prayer from school, has removed all aspects of God from school for both teachers and students. I have relatives who are teachers and they cannot even proclaim their faith in desk ornaments or shirts or pictures, for fear that it will offend a student. I find that is a direct violation of freedom of speech. The display of such items of faith is not imposing that faith on the students, but rather a mere action of the teacher proclaiming his or her beliefs. Also, if science can teach evolution an equal balance of creation as it is known from the Bible should be allowed. I pray for His quick return as I am so discouraged by the societal decline of our nation, so much that I fear for my children as they grow and I long for the day that all the world’s problems will be no more and we all be in heaven with our Lord and King.
