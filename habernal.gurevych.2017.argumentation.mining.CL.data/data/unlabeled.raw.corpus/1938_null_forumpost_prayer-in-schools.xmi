Either that or you are an anarchist, communist, or a christian theocrat. Obviously you aren't aware that it is the job of the Supreme Court to interpret what the meaning of the Constitution is today. It isn't a matter of right (which in this case it is morally right), it is a matter of a correct legal decision. &#10;And it isn't 1787 any more either, did you notice that? By reading the Constitution, decisions by the Supreme Court, commentaries on the Constitution, and case law I can pretty much learn what the Constitution means today. You see, the framers of the Constitution, unlike you, realized that it would not always be 1787, so they included methods to amend and to interpret the principles that they wrote into it. So sad that you would prefer a theocracy in which your religion is the law - kinda like the Taliban, only &quot;christian&quot;. &#10;No I don't. I assumed that you knew that Supreme Court decisions had the force of law. You're agreement is irrelevant. I way, way overestimated your knowledge of the topic. &#10;&quot;The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority.&quot; Yep. In any dispute involving the meaning of the Constitution, whatever the Court decides is true. However, what you think is largely irrelevant. Why don't you take it up with the people who wrote the Constitution. Oh! Wait! It's not 1787 anymore, is it? Then why don't you try to get enough support to amend the Constitution? But that doesn't fit into your christian fascism philosophy, does it? At any rate, it is the Constitution that allows you to speak out and advocate it's overthrow. &#10;Liberal agenda? To correctly characterize that comment would get me kicked off this board. Do you ever learn what you are talking about before you speak? &#10;John Roberts - Extremely conservative. Not quite as ultra conservative as Rehnquist, but already falling in on the side of Scalia and Thomas in any case involving religion. Far right of center (.140 Segal-Cover score). &#10;John Paul Stevens - Very slightly conservative. Just right of center. Very middle of the road. (.475 Segal-Cover score). &#10;Antonin Scalia - Ultra-extreme conservative. (.000 Segal-Cover score).&#10;Anthony Kennedy - Strongly conservative. (.200 Segal-Cover score).&#10;David Souter - Moderate conservative (.365 Segal-Cover score).&#10;Clarence Thomas - Ultra-extreme conservative, general chauvinist. (.070 Segal-Cover score).&#10;Ruth Bader Ginsburg - Moderate liberal. (.680 Segal-Cover score).&#10;Steven Breyer - Moderate conservative. (.325 Segal-Cover score).&#10;Samuel Alito - Ultra conservative. (.150 Segal-Cover score).&#10;By the way, .000 conservative &lt;-&gt; liberal 1.000&#10;That gives the entire court an average Segal-Cover score of .267. That's conservative.&#10;Or you'll put on your sheets and hoods and burn a cross on my front lawn? I thought as much. That's what the christians in Santa Fe, TX did because they couldn't use to PA system to pray at football games. The trouble was that they got the wrong family - the picked a Jewish family when the plaintiffs in the case were both Christians. But is seems that we can expect such treatment when we object to being forced into christian prayer. I actually expected as much from you. It seems that you and the people of your town aren't too much different than the christians of Santa Fe. You must admire David Duke very much. &#10;How dismally ignorant. Have you bothered to actually check out the Court or any branch of the government? Liberal? You don't pay much attention, do you? &#10;But it isn't. It does make me certain that you have never actually read the Constitution or any commentary that explains what it meant in 1787 or what it means now. Of course, like the christians of 1787, you actually oppose the Constitution. Great christian patriots like Patrick Henry worked very hard to defeat ratification of both the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The major opposition to ratification of both came from christian pulpits. &#10;I myself have read the Constitution, much of Madison's Journal, much of the Federalist Papers, lots of Supreme Court decisions, and lots of case law. You have read nothing. &#10;By the way, Phoenixfire, I completely agree with you. I also appreciate the fact that you're wanting to teach. We need good teachers. Just between you and me, you can teach at my school. We don't have to deal with whining anti-theists down here, and nothing at all like the scenario at the top has EVER happened down here. A lot of this stuff is regional, and there are many places it is more prominant. I.E. Cal(iberal)fornia.[/QUOTE]He can teach anyplace as long as he has the required education and certification. What he can't do as a teacher in a public school is to wave his Bible in his students faces while he teaches chemistry. Previously I would have encouraged him to act like a Christian and very carefully respect the religious rights of his students. After having dealt with you, I can see that acting like a christian may not be what I have in mind. Maybe I should say to act like an atheist and leave religion out of it. &#10;Right.&#10;Mat 6:6 &quot;But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.&quot; &#10;And christians, when they try to make sure that everyone can see them praying with public monuments, school prayer don't even realize that they are being hypocrites. Doesn't speak very well for their religion, does it? &#10;I think you've got it. In this country the fundamentalist christians control the three branches of government, they ignore the Constitution almost at will with &quot;faith based government aid,&quot; our &quot;leaders&quot; pray at official events, and so on. There is little persecution of christians going on, so they just create situations that lets them feel that they are being persecuted. The claim that their freedom of religion involves imposing it on others. They are working towards a christian version of the Taliban.[/quote] "/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="6172" language="en" documentId="1938" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="gallo" date="13th September 2006 12:45 PM" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://www.volconvo.com/forums/showthread.php?t=11753&amp;page=4" topic="prayer-in-schools" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="1938" notes="" title="The Bible in Public Schools"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="381"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="382" end="912"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="913" end="1086"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="1087" end="1775"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="1776" end="1930"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="1931" end="2150"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="63" sofa="1" begin="2151" end="2272"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="2273" end="2343"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="71" sofa="1" begin="2344" end="2410"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="75" sofa="1" begin="2411" end="2473"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="79" sofa="1" begin="2474" end="2565"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="83" sofa="1" begin="2566" end="2631"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="87" sofa="1" begin="2632" end="2696"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="91" sofa="1" begin="2697" end="2757"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="95" sofa="1" begin="2758" end="2805"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="99" sofa="1" begin="2806" end="2892"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="103" sofa="1" begin="2893" end="3511"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="107" sofa="1" begin="3512" end="3665"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="111" sofa="1" begin="3666" end="4116"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="115" sofa="1" begin="4117" end="4290"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="119" sofa="1" begin="4291" end="5228"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="123" sofa="1" begin="5229" end="5235"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="127" sofa="1" begin="5236" end="5434"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="131" sofa="1" begin="5435" end="5654"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="135" sofa="1" begin="5655" end="6172"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59 63 67 71 75 79 83 87 91 95 99 103 107 111 115 119 123 127 131 135"/></xmi:XMI>
