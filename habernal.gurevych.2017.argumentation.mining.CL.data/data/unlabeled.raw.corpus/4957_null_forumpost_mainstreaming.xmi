Don't forget your son is still quite young and he needs to do small steps to make progress. Yes he might do them easily, but its better that way than to make them unattainable. &#10;I think you need to sort out the statement whether he goes to Mainstream or Special school.&#10;And reading your post, I think you are leaning towards the Special school for your son. You know your son and if this is the best place for him then go for it. I know that you are worried that he may not get in, but you have to try if you believe it to be the best place. It is a difficult choice, but if it helps why not write down the pro's and cons of him going to each school. &#10;I know of a boy in our area, who went to our local school until he was 8. He is autistic but the school coped with his needs and he made progress. The last year was difficult so his parents decided to send him to our local special school. Unfortunately, it did not go well there. My point here is please don't write off Mainstream school as not having the experienced staff or strategies for coping with children like ours. Whilst it is true that not all schools have an excellent provision for children with Autism, some do and the children can thrive. My sons 1:1 has done a course at Uni on Autism and has lots of strategies to help him. He has made wonderful progress there and we are very pleased. &#10;Sorry, I hope that hasn't confused you more!&#10;Good Luck and keep us posted!"/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1499" language="en" documentId="4957" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Julie C(396)" date="03-04-10 00:52" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://www.netmums.com/coffeehouse/netmums-coffeehouse-archives-528/primary-school-admission-appeals-clinic-599/404307-special-educational-needs-re-mainstream-school-all.html" topic="mainstreaming" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="4957" notes="" title="Special Educational Needs re.
