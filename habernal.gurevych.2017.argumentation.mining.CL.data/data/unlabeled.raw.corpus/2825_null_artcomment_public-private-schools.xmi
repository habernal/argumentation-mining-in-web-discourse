I received my Master Degree in Teaching and what I learned in my History of Education class was scary. During the 20th c. school became a preparation factory for the captains of industry (Ford, Carnegie, Rockefeller, and the like).  These men put more into the Public School system than tax dollars did and their power was awesome.  Independent thinkers and individuals are hard to control. Public schools took children from various backgrounds (huge immigration waves) and enabled the gov't to &quot;Americanize&quot; them through factory model schools. The school year was lengthened, as was the mandatory period of instruction, so that the family was undermined.  The generations of children that followed were estranged from the old countries and their parents' ways.  They were easily made consumers and employees of industry:  easy to control and used to monotonous work. I know I sound like I have a tin foil hat on, but we read the documents.  John Taylor Gatto writes and references the &quot;progression&quot; in his &quot;An Underground History of American Education.&quot;  It's seriously disturbing.  After going through that class I knew I could never send my child to public school.
