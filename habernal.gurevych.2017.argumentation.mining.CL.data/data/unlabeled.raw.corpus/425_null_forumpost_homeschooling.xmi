This is my freshman year and several of my classes are online. I now have the freedom schedule wise that comes with homeschooling and the requirement to get my school work done and turned in. &#10;As for the overprotectiveness, I am not overly sheltered. Yes, my mom doesn't want me getting into social networking. There are certain things I can't watch yet (like Supernatural. That makes me sad. I really want to watch that/). And there are certain things I can't do. BUT my mom isn't as overprotective as some. I have been on the internet (as you can see), I text my friends from my iPod (sadly, no cell phone), I've seen two R rated movies (but I'm 14 so really this isn't a big deal at the moment). Though one of them was the Passion which I was forced to watch, so I wouldn't count that. The other one was the Call, which was great! &#10;My mom's restrictions in the social area kind of confuses me. I go to the library to do school sometimes by myself. So I can go certain places alone. However, she doesn't let me spend time with a friend for more than 4 hours. (don't ask. I just know it has something to do with an article about adjusting back to family life) BUT she's letting me go to the March for Life by myself (and by by myself, I mean with a group from my church, but I'm the only member of my family going) and she knows that my best friend is going. So socially, I'm restricted, but not. I'm going to be in DC for a week, but she won't let me stay at a friends for more than 4 hours. I'm officially confused. &#10;I don't remember ever getting the talk, but I know. I know how babies are made, born, and the like. I don't think I officially was given the talk, but I kind of put it all together from what I learned from the world, friends who already knew, and the snippets I got from my parents. Plus I have two older siblings (they're in college now) so I got exposed to things earlier on.
