The public reaction on the issue of homosexuality was to be expected. But what flew almost completely under the radar was the following: &#10;&quot;We believe that the heavens and the earth and all original life forms, including humanity, were made by the specific immediate creative acts of God as described in the account of origins presented in Genesis, and that all biological changes which have occurred since creation are limited to variation within each species.&quot; &#10;This is a flat out denial of the scientific principles of Evolution and has no place in our schools. Darwin's central tenet was that species evolve by mutations, a principle that has been verified as scientific fact by multiple branches of science, including DNA analysis. The school might just as absurdly have insisted that the Sun and the planets spin around the Earth. Any school teaching this garbage should have their government funding cancelled immediately. That it was passed over by our media is a disgrace. That this school will continue to teach this nonsense is almost certain. As their website says: &quot;We do not see Christian beliefs as something to add on to a secular belief system but rather the starting point from which all areas of the curriculum are developed.&quot; &#10;Why should children be abused with these outrageous falsehoods, all paid for by the taxpayer?&#10;Well said.....funny how furore over their anti-homosexuality stance clouded perhaps a more serious issue.
