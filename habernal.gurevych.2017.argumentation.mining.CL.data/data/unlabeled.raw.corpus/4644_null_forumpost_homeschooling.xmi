It used to be part of the 10th grade curriculum in my state. I learned how to drive in driver’s education. My parents’ biggest involvement was taking me to the DMV on my 16th bday to get my license. Today, in my county at least, there is no driver's ed course in high school. DH and I spent hours last year teaching ODD how to drive. As part of the license requirement, we also had to hire a private driving instructor and enroll ODD in a driver’s ed course. The cost for both run between $750 on the cheap end and $2,500 on the high end. ODD has friends that do not have their licenses, because their families cannot afford the training. Instead, these kids wait until their 18th bday when there are no requirements to get a license, or they just drive without licenses (a growing trend in our state).&quot; &#10;In my state, you cannot graduate HS until you have passed driver ed.&#10;So at 16, you get a permit, and depending on when your BD is you take driver ed. at school, there are summer classes for those with the later BD's. You must pass the written and road tests. Some parents do use private teaching schools so that the student has a &quot;boost up&quot; and even those with learning disabilities are given other tests. Parents have to pay driver ed. fees, licensing fees, insurance and your prize is a 16 year old with a license who can't understand why he still has a 10 o'clock curfew. &#10;And we also have the other end of the spectrum, those who take the driver ed. class, pay all the fees and drop out at 16-3/4; thinking they have it made. &#10;I did take driver ed. way back when, because my own mother didn't drive and my stepfather didn't have the patience to teach me. But in that state you had to be 17 to get a license. I took the classes, got my permit and graduated in June. I got my license 4 months after graduation.
