Why do we not hear THEIR empowered voices over media sharing concerns? Is it because the &quot;adults&quot; are in control of their voices? Is it because we refuse to listen? Is it because they do not speak up? Is it because we accept that public school is GOOD for them inspite of themselves? Why do we listen to this boy who was homeschooled, but not children who are publicschooled? &#10;It is a very natural developmental stage for children to rebel against their restraints. I think it is too bad this very creative and empowered young man took the national stage to voice his rebellion. In doing so, he has bolstered homeschooling stereotypes. However, I think it is a bit silly to base generalization on this unique scenario... particularly since this young man is successful and personally empowered: traits the majority of public schooled children are trained out of. &#10;I feel myself empowered to make these large statements because I was unschooled. I attended 1 1/2 years of high school. &#10;I achieved abysmal scores on SATs, years behind in math, and slept-in every morning. And yes, I did play a lot of video games and didn't have very many friends. &#10;Stop. Re-read that. Is that because I was homeschooled? No.&#10;What the hell happened to me eventually?&#10;I completed a B.F.A, &amp; M.A.E, taught abroad as an ajunct professor, traveled to many countries, worked with women's liberation non-profit groups, and finally... my ongoing career: a PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER &#10;I think culture within the United States promotes oversimplifying all perspectives. I believe this oversimplification is deeply embedded in American opinions. This quality is learned from our public school system which trains us in labeling and categorizing human qualities.
