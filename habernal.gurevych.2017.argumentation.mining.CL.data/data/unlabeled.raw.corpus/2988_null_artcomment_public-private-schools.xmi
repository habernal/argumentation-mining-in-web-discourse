All students are not the same in ability, goals and learning styles.  To force all students to study the same material at the same level is not at all productive.  The first few years I taught HS English, we  tracked 9th and 10th grade according to ability levels and taught the same subject matter -- just at the level that each group could understand and learn. We contracted and weighted grades and adjusted student tracks as needed.  We offered semester classes to juniors and seniors which included college prep rhetoric, popular literature, mythology, business English, poetry, drama and others.  We worked with students, parents and counselors to make sure each student signed up for classes that benefited both goals and interests.  All it took was two school board meetings to switch back to English I, II, III, IV -- random mix of students.  More capable students -- bored; slower students -- lost; middle of the road students -- doing OK.  Special ed students -- totally bored and frustrated.    I left public school teaching because I became increasingly frustrated with all the state and fed mandates, lack of parental support and involvement and ridiculous school funding practices -- i.e. property taxes.  More time became focused on paper mandates than actual teaching.  By the time the mandate was in place -- it was thrown out and the next one had to be implemented.  Minimum competency, no child left behind and now core teaching -- take your pick.   I taught for several years in a private school and was delighted with the freedom to teach and the support from parents and administration.  The difference is incredible for students, teachers and parents!   So -- I don't know what the solution is for the public schools.  Certainly forcing parents to send kids to a troubled public school is not the answer.  Parents should not have to pick up the deficit from inadequate curriculum and teaching!  Help their kids, support and encourage them -- yes!
