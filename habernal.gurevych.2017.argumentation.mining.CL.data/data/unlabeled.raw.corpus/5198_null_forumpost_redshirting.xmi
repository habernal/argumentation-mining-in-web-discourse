A few months does make a difference when they're that young. Increasing the age spread from 12 months difference to 18 months difference, makes the younger kids seem more immature than they are. &#10;Have you ever spent a significant amount of time in your child's school? Not just in their class for a party? I stated before that I'm at my DD's elementary school all the time. I tutor, work in the library, in the copy room and help with various projects. I've gotten to know the kids very well and have seen them in various settings not just at a class party or a play date. I spend hours every week in the kindergarten classroom and in the 5th grade class tutoring as well as individual tutoring with kids in various grades. &#10;You honestly cannot tell the difference in the ages of the kids. Every once in a while a child might stand out but it's not that often and the reason they are standing out is usually not because they seem &quot;older&quot; or &quot;younger&quot;. I'd almost be curious to do an experiment in the K class I tutor in and write down who I think is older and who I think is younger and then find out their ages and birthdays. I guarantee you that I would probably be wrong on a lot of them. Which means that they all blend very well together and it's not as big of a deal as people make it out to be. &#10;I guess what I'm trying to say is that we all have opinions on this but until you spend time with these kids in the classroom setting, talk to educators and do actual research on it then you don't really have a clear picture of how it truly is affecting the kids or the classroom.
