What makes you so confident school is good for you? How can you be so sure, even when through detailed research and analysis academics present evidence to the contrary, the point of the article? There is an implication in this country that schools are saints, pillars of the community. Should this be what we aspire to for our schools? &#10;School has become the front line of social engineers. As such it has little interest in the child, and is more concerned with promoting an imaginary egalitarian utopia. As such the school system is a little too interested in nature, and not interested enough in nurture. &#10;Learning is good for you, force fed institutionalized factory teaching is extremely inefficient and inhuman, and likely a complete waste of your time. &#10;There are many books written about why the modern school system, from it's prussian inception onwards, is actually a complete failure. Perhaps you would be able to construct a decent argument had you read and digested some of them. &#10;@pastis&#10;Although far from perfect, the french model is better than here. It is about education, and that's it. no compulsory extra-curricular activities (sport, art), no pretending to be good for the community. just academics. Schools are far less political. They don't confuse welfare with the school system. The family is still important in France. The school system knows where to stop. It's interesting their less is more approach is compatible with their notion of egalite. Britain could learn a lot from that. The French system aspires to be non-political. It is not interested in rich and poor, clever and thick. There is equality of access, but not equality of outcome. Essentially it's about achievement.
