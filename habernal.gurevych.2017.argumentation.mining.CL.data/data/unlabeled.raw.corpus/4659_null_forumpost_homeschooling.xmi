I think as with anything - a lot depends on the particular school system and even the particular school these days. When we were house hunting - before we ever even had children, we &quot;shopped&quot; schools if you will. In our state, some counties are definitely better than others, even just within a few miles of each other. If you live in an area where the public schools aren't great and you have great private or charter schools then you have options. If you live in an area where the public schools, private schools and charter schools aren't great, sometimes homeschooling is the only option. Some people home school because they feel that their local schools, even parochial schools, don't offer the same value set they wish for their child's education. On the other hand, in our case, we are very blessed to have K-12 neighborhood schools that are rated top in the state consistently with more than 95% of the (testable) students at or above grade level benchmarks each year. A friend of mine transferred her son in last year from a local private school that was supposed to be working at a higher pace than public schools and he was behind his grade level in our public schools. A lot depends on the particular schools you are dealing with I think. &#10;Then again, as others have said, we also have a lot of parental and community involvement as well, being Small Town USA.
