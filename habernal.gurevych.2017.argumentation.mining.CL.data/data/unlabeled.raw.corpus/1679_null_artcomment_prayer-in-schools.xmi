For the first few centuries following Christ’s life, Christians’ lives were in great danger for claiming such a title. However the faith continued to spread by means of peace despite the persecution. This changed in (I think) the third or fourth century when (I believe) Alexander had a vision which changed his faith. Now instead of killing those who confessed Christ as their savior, he killed those who would not accept his faith. Christianity began to spread by means of violence rather than peace. It became the religion of the state, and “Christians” were became not only those who truly believed, but also those who were forced to pretend to for the sake of their lives. The church became the persecutor. Many consider this time to be the fall of Christianity (but that is only an opinion-you decide what to think of it). The faith’s role as a state religion and persecutor was carried into the medieval times, when the church became so powerful that it was able to massacre Muslims and Jews in the name of Christ through a series of wars called the crusades. This power made the church so corrupted that its leaders made the common people believe they could buy their loved ones’ salvation from purgatory (and the church leaders pocketed the profit from these indulgences). Though the reformation helped, the church carried its status into the days of colonizing North America, when among other reasons immigrants fled Europe because of such state-led relgious persecution. In the North American continent, people were allowed to worship as they thought fit for Christ, not as the state forced them to. Based on this principle, when the United States formed the founding fathers explicitly set forth the separation of church and state within the constitution. Now we debate the morality of prayer in schools. I sympathize with your belief that the U.S. was founded on Christian principles and ought not to stray. But the more important question us followers of Christ must ask is what is truly best for Christianity? History has shown that when Christianity becomes one with the state, corruption and persecution on the part of the church are soon to follow. So as Christians, let us be in the world but not of it, let us hold ourselves to our own moral standards rather than the state holding all to these standards. If the state is to be responsible for regulating morality, and Christianity is to become, as you wish, a state-religion, then followers of Christ surely face the danger of worldly power corrupting our faith.
