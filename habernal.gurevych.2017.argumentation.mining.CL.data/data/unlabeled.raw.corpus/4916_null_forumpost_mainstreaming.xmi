They are definetely worth it.&#10;They worked with my foster sister who had learning and behavioural problems, she was taught as an equal, and not only learnt their curriculum, but also learnt how to behave as well. &#10;my brother has had issues with behaviour and was suspected to have ADHD and suffered terribly in mainstream school - he was bullied by many students, and teachers did not know how to deal with him. He is incredibly bright and smart, but does not learn from sitting down quietly whilst being talked to. Teachers became almost scared of him and he would be frequently kicked out of the classroom for challenging a teacher on a certain subject, which in my opinion it is a good thing, but he was always treated as if he was 'bad'. A major reason for not having him in that school is simply for the sake of the other pupils - the time spent repeatedly kicking him out, the others could have been learning something. &#10;There is a bit of a difficulty when it comes to people that are not 'behind'. My brother being actually very bright, and my sister, who is in a wheelchair, had a horrible time in mainstream school, but was fairly able physically, and had no issues with learning/behaviour. &#10;I do believe that when i was in secondary school, (altho mine was a little posh), they dont push the people that dont achieve. I spent my entire secondary school life in the bottom set in maths, with no real belief that i would do well - 'self fulfulling prophecy' springs to mind...
