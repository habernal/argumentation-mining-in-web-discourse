So very Christian. &#10;95% born in Australia doesn't mean all white. There are plenty of non-white people born here.&#10;Interesting comments. I work in the Catholic system of schools in Sydney. We don't charge $30 000 fees. The majority of our students are from a Language Background other Than English - 64% according to last census data.Some are from middle class backgrounds but many are from low SES. As for the comment - not up to standard compared to the public sector? There is quality education in both systems. I know this because I have worked in Public, Catholic systemic and Independent school systems. Dream on. &#10;&quot;Australian-born&quot; doesn't necessarily make them &quot;of Anglo-Saxon heritage&quot;.&#10;Yes we should send our kids to the public/ AFLand NRL fanclub schools definately no racism there. &#10;You don't have to be a white Anglo Saxon to be born in Australia!&#10;I am amazed that in an inclusive public school environment, there would be a need for selective schools for those who are &quot;more equal&quot; than everyone else. &#10;I like how these days not wanting to be a minority in your OWN country is considered racist! Because that's where we are heading people. &#10;What it DOES mean, without a doubt, is &quot;not from another country&quot;. It is, quite effectively, discrimination. All children, no matter where they are born, have the right to (feel that they are) welcome at school. This school ought to be pulled up about this startling remark. What of the 5% in their tuition who are NOT Australian born, yet in their care? How would they (and their parents) feel about the singling out of their background as a negative (essentially the polar opposite aspect of the proud statement they make in their demographic being &quot;95% Australian born&quot;). Imagine a mother gloating that &quot;3 out of my 4 kids are boys!&quot; What are we to assume about the daughter? Please publicise the name of this inner city Catholic school. I will follow it up, the CECV Diocesan director will be interested. My kids go to a Catholic school, I would say that at LEAST half the kids are from other countries, something truly to be proud of. Such a statement can't be condoned, either by the community, church or public in general. Poor parents, how mortified many would be now to be associated with that school. &#10;If the catholic schools say they cater for the same sort of kids as in the public system why is there a separate system with all the corresponding wasted resources that the Liberals are always talking about. I have no qualms about a private system that is private with no government money but I do have qualms about a government subsidised system that call itself private. &#10;Yeah. The only downside is a huge focus on religion. A real turn off&#10;B, a &quot;minority in you own country&quot;? Since when was it anyone's country, Australia will be Australia and can be &quot;your&quot; country for as long as you want it to be. If you decide to disown Australia because there is a multicultural presence, that's YOUR prerogative. Still a fraction of the population come from overseas (and many of British/European background) so it'll be fair while before descendants of the first fleet (which I'm assuming you are?) become the &quot;minority&quot;. This country doesn't belong to the first white settlers, it doesn't actually even belong to the Aborigines. It belongs to whoever loves living here and will call it home. &#10;Yes bernieb, that is so very Christian. Only they could get away with such blatant racism. And who would dare challenge them on it ? Certainly not the govt. But don't use your own right to free speech against this attitude for fear of being accussed of inciting hatred.
