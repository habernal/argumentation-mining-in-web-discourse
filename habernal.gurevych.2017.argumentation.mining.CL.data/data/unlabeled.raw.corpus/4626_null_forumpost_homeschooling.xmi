I came to understand, very quickly, how each of the boys differed in how they caught on to things, how they interpreted ideas and how they retained material. When faced with the issue that &quot;your son is hyperactive&quot; - I challenged the teachers. (Issues with teachers). Why was he hyperactive in your class and just fine in the other class? Hmmm. &#10;I consider myself to be well read, articulate and intelligent. But I know that I was not capable of home schooling them. I may be able to read French, but I cannot understand algebra at all. I may be able to interpret literature and poetry, but I can only spell calculus. I can spell hydrogen and physics, I can teach you to parallel park, but I have no idea how to dissect a frog. &#10;When they wanted to know how to type, I taught them, the way I was taught. When they wanted to make volcanoes out of baking soda and vinegar, I was all for it. &#10;Their father graduated first in his HS class, and graduated with honors from college; but he had no patience when it came to teaching them. Although strangely enough, he tutored several of their classmates in advanced math and sciences and those guys did great. &#10;I challenged teachers when I thought that the subject matter was below par and argued that teachers needed to refresh themselves and stop presenting the same old boring materials. (When ODS was a college sophomore and realized that his HS freshman brother was reading the same books as he did, I challenged the teacher). I argued that Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet and The Great Gatsby were not the greatest reading materials for students who had just attended the funerals of 5 classmates. &#10;I was proud of my YDS when he decided to teach the subjects he loved so much. But I was so frustrated for him when he was told that he gave too much homework, he was too strict with discipline and too unbending in his standards. He found that trying to teach the &quot;snowflakes&quot; in the same way he had been taught was not appreciated by parents and administrators alike. It saddened us all when he was &quot;let go&quot; and he has turned away from academics completely.
