In their local high schools. These are their neighbours. Why do they live in these areas if their neighbours are such disasters. Our children have attended an inner city govt state high with a brilliant mix of students and staff, no uniforms and had a great education. The school is consistently in the top 15% of VCE results and have experiences equal to those of elitist private schools. Best of all it is a religious free zone and I doubt whether there would be one LNP voter in the whole school. &#10;This is a good point. My wife's sister and her husband are medical specialists and planned a large family. They moved to be in the feeder areas of a good government primary and secondary school to avoid the expense of sending five children to non-government schools. They are happy with the outcome, and have a better quality of patient with practices in the same area. I suspect all the parents are LNP voters. &#10;I think however the author might be just as unhappy with this sort of segregation as the non-government/government school divide, and would probably support busing medical specialists children to schools in Department of Housing areas to provide social diversity! &#10;So you're aware how every parent in the school votes, Sipper? I'm impressed at your polling/mind reading skills- you must have been privately educated. Most people couldn't afford to live in your inner city enclave because the housing is not affordable due to the excellent tax breaks you get from negatively gearing all your investment properties (which you've crowed about on previous occasions) pushing the rent up. Get down off your perch, take your latte (in your reusable cup, no doubt) and ride the Upfield line out to Broady and see how many kids are excelling at the local government schools. &#10;Yes sipper we all know you have been happy with the public education system in an upper class suburb. Would you of sent them to a public school if you lived in a lower SES burb. MORE THAN LIKELY NOT ! &#10;Hollow sentiments from a latte leftie&#10;I will be one but only reluctantly. I'd like to send my child to the public highschool I went to, however in the intervening years the population of the school has literally halved as 3 private schools have sprung up and siphoned the the higher socioeconomic background kids away. What was quite a good school was recently described as &quot;Mt Druitt by the sea&quot; by one teacher to me in private after he'd taught in Mt Druitt and move to the coast where I am. When you take the top half of the &quot;good kids&quot; (given outcomes are related to socioeconomics and parent interest in education) and leave the bottom half behind, even though there will still be some smart cookies left, you've just massively increased the percentage of students from troubled backgrounds. I wanted my children to have a rounded education with people of all backgrounds, not the opposite of being surrounded by toffs, ie surrounded by people from commission homes. If this area wasn't so beautiful I would move out to the hinterland to be with &quot;my people&quot; instead of being with everyone who can't afford a car so they need to live within walking distance of the dole office. For me it's purely about making sure they have a better class of friends. I never thought those words would come out of my mouth but I've been forced into this by government policy. Almost none of my lifelong friends would have been at that school with the current situation, their parents just wouldn't have sent them there, and neither would have mine. &#10;Andrew I really feel for your situation. idiots that vote for the LNP are responsible for the ease that the churches can bang up schools every where stripping the middle class out of public schools. In the burbs and regions we have total class segregation by school type. Pathetic. &#10;real world, inner Melb is the most lefty electorate in Australia. Hopefully we will reelect the excellent Adam Bandt this weekend to counter the nutty climate sceptic LNP. Where do you live? &#10;I don't want to get anyone in trouble re: the Mt Druitt remark so I'll just say the far north coast of NSW. There are some high income areas, and high house prices, but in the CBD areas close to the water and amenity there aren't a lot of owner-occupiers hence some of the problems I've experienced. If I moved into the hinterland (McMansion surburban baby factory) I wouldn't have had to break up a domestic on the street in front of my house with a baseball bat... I do actually worry about my children mixing with my neighbours. But with a baby it's just so nice to be close to the water for walks, be close to the hospital should something go wrong etc. I also wholly resent religious schools holding a gun to the head of my children's education. It's basically, &quot;Hey, risk your kid getting knocked up by some boy from the projects or come have some Jesus with your class seclusion&quot;. I'm basically being forced into handing over $50k in private school fees (it's much cheaper up here, we have far less people capable of paying $30k a year like inner city Melbourne and Sydney) or move. I can't in good conscious send my child to that school. It would be a dereliction of responsibility. All subsidies need to be removed. Keep private schools for those that can afford it by themselves, keep the other 90% in state schools (with selective and gifted programs). I don't want the bottom 50% of students in schools where parents care less and less. The kids from the top half won't get to keep their nice shiny things with an upset underclass for very long. Think of it as enlightened self interest if need be. &#10;Should of guest sipper a latte left greenie&#10;who has 3-4 cars in the garage, goes and annual overseas trips, air con, multi media to boot and all emitting masses of CO2. &#10;But believes that by paying $10 a week under a carbon price all sins are forgiven."/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="5985" language="en" documentId="4469" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="sipper" date="September 04, 2013, 8:39AM" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://www.theage.com.au/comment/private-schools-and-the-art-of-ripping-off-parents-20130903-2t357.html" topic="public-private-schools" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="4469" notes="" title="Private schools and the art of ripping off parents"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="624"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="625" end="1037"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="1038" end="1302"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="1303" end="1905"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="1906" end="2107"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="2108" end="2145"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="63" sofa="1" begin="2146" end="3645"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="3646" end="3928"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="71" sofa="1" begin="3929" end="4120"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="75" sofa="1" begin="4121" end="5732"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="79" sofa="1" begin="5733" end="5776"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="83" sofa="1" begin="5777" end="5902"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="87" sofa="1" begin="5903" end="5985"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59 63 67 71 75 79 83 87"/></xmi:XMI>
