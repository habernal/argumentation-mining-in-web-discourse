What I did learn was how to keep my head down in a group so I didn't stand out. How to pretend I didn't know things so I wasn't spotted as a geek. How to laugh at hurtful comments so I didn't get bullied. How to stay on side with the &quot;important&quot; and popular class members. &#10;But I did learn how to socialise by spending time with my parents, family and friends. I learnt how to be confident in myself and my opinions whilst respecting others. And I learnt how to get on and treat people with respect who were outside my immediate peer-group. I learnt that people who didn't look and speak the same as everyone else were still valuable friends and had something valuable to teach me. &#10;I also don't believe that school taught me very much. I was not allowed to go onto the free reading scheme at primary school because I had not progressed through the boring prescribed readers. They were dull dull dull, I could read, and the teachers following the system would not let me bypass them. Were the teachers interested in learning or conformity?? &#10;School is not the only, nor the best way to learn how to get on with others, nor is it always the best way to learn. Many people are failed by the system in terms of both learning and so-called &quot;socialisation&quot;. The government really does not know best for our children. Given this, it is not surprising that home educators are so unhappy to have the government dictate how they educate their own children, and threaten to withdraw the right to home educate if they are not seen to do it in the prescribed way.
