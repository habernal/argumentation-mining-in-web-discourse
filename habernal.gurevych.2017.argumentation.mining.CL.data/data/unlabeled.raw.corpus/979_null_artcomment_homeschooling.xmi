Without those the rest of education is a forlorn hope. They are learning these with the love and patience of their parents. They know it is important, we have shown them why, but we work with them to ensure they do know them and they learn them at their own pace without undue pressure. The school system failed our eldest, she started school being able to read and after 5 months of their efforts couldn't read a word. &#10;She now loves books and is back to her supposed age level on reading. She has a marvelous love for mathematics and is now several years ahead of her schooled counterparts. She decided she wanted to do a history of our village (done before), but she is slowly working through the information we have found together to make her own. &#10;In terms of predujice, she mixes with many special needs children equally, even though she does question their behaviour to us at times. She has friends who are Jewish and Muslim. She knows the difference between a Bamitzvah and a Batmitvah. Her uncle is a Muslim. &#10;She has to a large extent control over what she wants to learn. She learns by being involved in our family and friends, she learns by discussion, she learns by application; that is being allowed to do things, not shown. We facilitate her learning mainly, not prescribe it. If she's slow on some things we take our time, if she's quick on the uptake we push her harder. The choice is to a certain extent her's and how we react to it. She wants to do sums without numbers like mummy does. &#10;The point I'm trying to make is that parents don't take the option of home education on lightly. Most of us are scared at the start. It's schools that should do it. But what happens is something quite extrordinary. All kids want to learn. All you have to do is point them in the right direction and furnish them with what information you can. If they want it they will get it. &#10;They don't end up despising learning, they actively seek it out. Yes, you as the facilitator have control (initially) about the information. Once they find out about how to collate the information they do it themselves. &#10;You just have to plant the seed in the right place and nurture it. I suspect the state is less selective than that, which is why so many &quot;fail&quot;. Seed, wrong place, wrong ground, not nurtured. &#10;The Badman proposals are attempting to remove our opportunity for us to try an place our children into the right place, without the right nurture and impose the model of school on home educators. Did you realise that OFSTED have proposed that parents should be CRB checked before being allowed to home educate. How long before you will be CRB checked before being allowed to keep your child? &#10;This is bcomong more than just a fight against Badman for home educators, it should be becoming more of a fight against the state and it's intrusion into or lives. &#10;We are but the start. We are a small non affiliated group. Just wait until they come for you.&#10;What was it that someone wrote about the Nazis&#10;First they came for us and no one helped&#10;Then they came for X and no one helped&#10;Then they came for Y and no one helped&#10;Then they came for us and there was no one left to help."/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="3297" language="en" documentId="979" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="ericthepanda" date="07 November 2009 12:13am" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/6750741" topic="homeschooling" thumbsUp="8" thumbsDown="0" origId="979" notes="" title="Ridiculous rules for home schools"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="6"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="7" end="544"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="545" end="876"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="877" end="1142"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="1143" end="1630"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="1631" end="2008"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="63" sofa="1" begin="2009" end="2229"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="2230" end="2422"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="71" sofa="1" begin="2423" end="2815"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="75" sofa="1" begin="2816" end="2980"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="79" sofa="1" begin="2981" end="3074"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="83" sofa="1" begin="3075" end="3121"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="87" sofa="1" begin="3122" end="3162"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="91" sofa="1" begin="3163" end="3201"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="95" sofa="1" begin="3202" end="3240"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="99" sofa="1" begin="3241" end="3297"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59 63 67 71 75 79 83 87 91 95 99"/></xmi:XMI>
