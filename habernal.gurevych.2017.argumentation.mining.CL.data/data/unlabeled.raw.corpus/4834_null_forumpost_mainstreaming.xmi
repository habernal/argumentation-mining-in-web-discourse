Not only do the average kids need to learn to be around/help/get to know mentally handicapped and physically handicapped people, but the special needs child needs to learn how to live in the world, which is populated by lots of average people as well as other special needs people. There are obviously cases where this isn't going to work. Extreme behavioral trouble, kids that just aren't able to keep up with what they're learning in average classes, etc. But on the whole, I like mainstreaming. We had some kinds in our high school that were mainstreamed. One in particular was deaf and it sparked an interest in sign language in our high school. &#10;Would this have worked in a larger, less-nurturing town or school?&#10;I works in schools of all sizes across the nation. I'm not saying special needs students are all turned into super popular super stars, but they get by and there's a level of tolerance that wouldn't be there without them. It doesn't matter where you send a child to school, there will be a time when someone says something nasty or teases them, or they can't keep up or don't get the joke, or don't get picked for the team. It's all in how you raise them to deal with their world, and how the school administration does or does not choose to deal with it. &#10;Are there dangers or long-lasting effects associated with this that need to be considered?&#10;There's the long-lasting effect on typical students of having more tolerance. I think it's wonderful. Due to mainstreamed kids with special needs I learned sign language, how to work a braille machine and a motorized wheelchair, and a lot LOT of patience for classroom disruptions, and that maybe you should just talk to someone even if they look or act a lot different than you. And since I went to a small rural all-white school, I could have learned a lot less tolerance without exposure to special needs kids. &#10;As for lasting effects on special needs kids, it's tough to say because each child will have a different experience. Some kids will have a rougher time because others will make fun or be mean to them. In that case it's no good. Some kids will have a wonderful experience and make some good life-long friends, even if they can't join their friends in college for whatever reason. They'll still be friends, and they'll have learned valuable things about social interaction that are harder to learn stuck in the special ed classroom. &#10;While I only read your synopsis of the article, I would have to say that this boy had a great time in school, and those friends aren't just going to disappear because they went off to college. They'll come back and hang out during break and in the summer. This boy's parents need to find out what HE wants to do and help him achieve as much of that as he can. There are services out there specifically for that purpose. He can go to the ARC and they can help him find a way to have an apartment, help him find a way to maybe even go to community college and get a tutor. It's hard to let your children go, and even harder when you're afraid they might fail. But it wold be a disservice to him not to try to help him realize his dreams.
