This is not a strict home-public schooling dichotomy. You do have some other options, like private, magnet, or charter schools. &#10;For my elementary school education, I went to an awesome little public school. It was an older campus with a gorgeous library, and I had a bunch of hardworking, acquiescing teachers who happily wrote new curriculum for me when I got bored with the advanced placement programs.After elementary school, I spent all of my junior and high school years at a tiny charter school. It's like a public school in that tuition is free, but we get little to no state funding and get to decide our own curriculum. It had a different atmosphere than a normal public high school. You were there because you chose to, not because you had to be. You were there to learn, to go to college, and to make something of your brief little life. My classmates were equal parts focused and goofy, intelligent and inane. All around awesome people to spend some seven years with. &#10;Half of the novels in my lit class were photocopies because we couldn't afford new ones. Our textbooks' spines were taped and taped again. I remember receiving a book on my first day of a Real High School Literature Class, picking it up off my desk, and watching a hundred page chunk of it fall out. Apparently, it was a twenty year old book and part of a class set my professor nabbed when he quit his last teaching gig to found my school. I stitched it up, and he let me keep it. Still one of the most profoundly impactful books to my young self. &#10;My teachers were incredible and dynamic for the vast majority of my years there. This is due to a lot of things, but namely because teachers were hired for their expertise in their subject and my school did not offer tenure. If you worked at my high school, you kept your job by being good at it, not because you'd been around too long to shake off. Because of this, my classes were directed by some of the most singularly enthusiastic and devoted people I've ever encountered, even in university. &#10;My school's classrooms were too small, its supplies dwindling, its teachers grossly underpaid, and its survival a constant struggle. &#10;It's also one of the top 100 high schools in the country. Attending was an invaluable experience that I'm constantly grateful for. &#10;In my deeply humble opinion, you don't often get that from homeschooling. You don't even get that from most public high schools. &#10;I'm aware that I'm an outlier, but I thought I'd give charter schools a shout out anyway."/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2552" language="en" documentId="439" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Imperatrix Xoco" date="October 27, 2013 22:34" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://nanowrimo.org/forums/age-group-teens/threads/128227?page=6" topic="homeschooling" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="439" notes="" title="Homeschooling - debate"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="164"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="165" end="1017"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="1018" end="1567"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="1568" end="2066"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="2067" end="2200"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="2201" end="2332"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="63" sofa="1" begin="2333" end="2462"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="2463" end="2552"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59 63 67"/></xmi:XMI>
