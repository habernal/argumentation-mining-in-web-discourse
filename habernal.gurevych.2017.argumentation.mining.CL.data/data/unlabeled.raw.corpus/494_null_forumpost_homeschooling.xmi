There were some teachers and people I disliked but that's life. I think life is full of structure like it or not. &#10;I think this is part of why I am (as unpopular an opinion as it is) fairly anti-homeschool. IRL I honestly don't know anyone who homeschools that isn't highly religious and basically wants to keep an eye on their children at all times, doesn't like the idea of their kids being gone that long, thinks their children are too &quot;special&quot; for regular school etc. I know that this board is much more diverse and those aren't even reasons to homeschool for some people, but it is all I have personally experienced. While homeschooling is appropriate in some scenarios - say a family who travels the world for work, someone in a TRULY horrid district (so many people &quot;think&quot; their schools aren't 'good enough' I'm talking truly bad schools here) without access to private school, and any special needs health/mental etc issues of the child. I think that &quot;assuming&quot; you can better educate your child alone at home than 20+ different teachers over 13 years is pretty presumptuous. Some teachers will not be your children's favorites and will be hard for them to deal with - that's a GOOD thing. Sometimes your children will be bored in school and want to act up or do something else but can't because they are in a classroom setting - again, a GOOD thing. These little things do lots in terms of preparing the special snowflakes for real life as well. A good &quot;send them to school&quot; parent will always supplement what their child is learning at school if they feel the desire or need, but will also realize that the independence of school and experiences is a big part of education too. My opinion is pretty set in stone on this one but that's my two cents lol. Homeschooling isn't always a bad thing, but I definitely think that it should be a last chance kinda option not a first choice for well rounded children.
