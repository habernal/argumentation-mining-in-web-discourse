We wouldn't know they existed if it hadn't been for the torah. Even if we ignore that fact, and only took the word of oral tradition to know that some tablets existed, it's still taking the words of men on nothing but, the belief without logical proof or empirical evidence. &#10;You'd think an Omnibenevolent god would make up some better rules like Thou shalt not molest children, or thou shalt not beat thy wife or something more profound. The first three rules show nothing but a egocentric jealous god, hardly the qualities I wish to worship. &#10;Yeah well it's better than the alternative, death for breaking the commandments.&#10;Again, you're assuming this &quot;publication&quot; even took place. I mean c'mon, really, do you REALLY think that a burning bush that isn't consumed by the fire can really write into stone, words to live by? Oh thats right, you believe the stone tablets existed.....Doh!I'm still waiting for evidence (not even proof) that the tablets existed in the first place.[quote] A person can neither add to nor subtract from the words of the stone tablets without deviating from the words of God. The stone tablets are the basis for the most popular religions, and are the ONLY words directly transcribed by GOD. It can NOT be interpretated by any person, it can only be read by each person.[quote] How do you know these are the only words transcribed by this god? Oh thats right, some book tells you this, a book written by guess who?.... MAN. Does being the basis for &quot;the most popular&quot; religions give you reason to believe any of it is true? Remember, everyone use to think the earth was flat and the sun revolved around us. Everyone was wrong once knowledge to the contrary was gained. &#10;Why should we listen to you? This sounds like hog wash to me. Who says &quot;NO PERSON sahll interpret the stone tablets? Aren't you doing this very thing you say we can't do? Sounds like an interpretation to me if you say that by interpreting, we are taking the lords name in vane. &#10;This is the only thing you've said that I agree with. Religion has it's own place, its called CHURCH or Synogog or Mosque, it doesn't require tax payer dollars and it insures that you corrupt your children in the faith you want them to be corrupted in.
