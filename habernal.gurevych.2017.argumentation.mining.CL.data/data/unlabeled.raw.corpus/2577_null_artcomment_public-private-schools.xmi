I went to public school for the first time. What they were teaching I had already learned in the  fifth and sixth grades. Public school really did a disservice to me.  A second rate education at best. I would have been better going to a foreign country!!!  My son went to public school. The worst mistake I have ever made. he was bullied in high school because he was small and he was an easy target. The bad apples who are in jail now beat the crap out of him and my son was expelled. Later he had a huge bruise/cut on his shoulder and arm and was brought into the school nurse , where they wanted him to say we beat him. When he told them the names of the kids who did this to him. their exact words &quot;The wouldn't do that&quot;.   Now all three of those little hoodlums are in jail for armed robbery &amp; assault and battery. I also sent my daughter to private school for grades k-5 until we moved out of the large city we were living in. The school was on the need improvement list  for the state. You must think we as parents are crazy not to want better for out children.
