I had never considered holding him back or even heard of it. My husband was soon persuaded by his friends from our private school where this is very popular that we should definitely hold him back. He was bright, social, had a better attention than most adults I know, and definitely ready for formal school. I enrolled him on time in K4. My husband and friends and teachers and stranger still give me grief about it. He loves school, he has lots of friends, he does great, but even his kindergarten teacher says I should hold him back solely based on his birth month. She says he is at the top academically and socially. The only thing she come up with, because she says he is very mature for his age, was that she has to tell him directions more than once when he should get it the first time. I asked if that was the only thing should we really hold him in Kindergarten again. She said that it would be easier for him if we did and he would be bigger for sports and he would drive sooner. Saying it would be easier, is like saying that I should have taken 11 th grade general math instead of calculus because it is easier and I would be assured an A. Challenging myself with Calculus made me work harder and better prepared me for college. I see the trend of wanting to make life easy in the parents that I talk to as well. They don’t want their kids to struggle. I think they run the risk of raising bored kids who run away from a challenge because they are used to everything being easy. I don’t know about sports. I don’t want my child to play football and there is no advantage in soccer and tennis according to Malcolm Gladwell, who, by the way, has a BA in history and is not really qualified to draw conclusions on scientific data. There is more data that says there is no advantage. Up until recently, the social sciences were thought not to use sound scientific research in their studies. These studies he touts are over a broad range of socioeconomic backgrounds, mostly public schools. It is like comparing apples to oranges to compare a girl with a single Mom in an inner city school to a boy with highly educated professional parents at the best private school in the state. Even Malcolm Gladwell said that these affluent white educated parents aren’t going to see the same benefits from red shirting as a poor, underrepresented minorities. However, how do I ignore the experience of parents and educators who say all Aug boys should be held back no matter what, for some scientists who have what I would call fuzzy data with too many variables.
