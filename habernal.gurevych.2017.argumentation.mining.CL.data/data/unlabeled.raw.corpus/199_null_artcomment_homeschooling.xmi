I didn't plan on my computer sending my comment yet!&#10;Parents have all the years before kindergarten to convince their kids that &quot;evolution&quot; never happened. In addition, they have the afternoons and evenings after regular classes during which they can continue to try to deny any possibility of evolution. &#10;As far as religious beliefs, every parent who has a strong church can take the kids to church, &quot;Sunday school&quot; or its equivalent, and any training their church offers to point their kids in what they think is the right direction. &#10;Taking on the responsibility of home schooling is a serious decision. You are responsible for teaching your children ALL subjects, not just religion and pro- or anti-creationism. You are responsible for English, math, reading, history, and any other subjects in which your kids are curious. If you cannot teach Algebra &amp; Geometry, then you are responsible for finding and paying for a tutor to help you teach these subjects. There are many books your kids should read even if you disagree with the story. You have to teach your kids about the genocidal practices of different governments over the centuries (Hitler &amp; the Jews, the British &amp; the Irish, the Indians, the South Africans, the Zulu, etc; Pol Pot &amp; his own people; Stalin &amp; his people, etc.). You have to teach your kids how to socialize with kids who have different backgrounds &amp; cultures and to do so without fighting or arguing. &#10;Unless parents can demonstrate the ability to explain math, sciences, history, novels vs true tales, and more, they have no business pretending to educate their children. I don't expect someone to have read &quot;The Prince&quot; before graduating from high school, but I do think kids should know the difference between the works of Mark Twain and those of Machiavelli. They should know the difference between WW1 &amp; WW2, at a minimum. Do the parents have any books besides the Bible at home? &#10;It's not fair to put blinders on children and shut out the light."/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1987" language="en" documentId="199" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="saoirse" date="7/29/2013 9:51 PM GMT+0200" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/students-home-schooling-highlights-debate-over-va-religious-exemption-law/2013/07/28/ee2dbb1a-efbc-11e2-bed3-b9b6fe264871_comment.html?commentID=washingtonpost.com/ECHO/item/1375127481-673-650" topic="homeschooling" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="199" notes="" title="Student’s home-schooling highlights debate over Va. religious exemption law"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="59"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="60" end="312"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="313" end="543"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="544" end="1437"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="1438" end="1921"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="1922" end="1987"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59"/></xmi:XMI>
