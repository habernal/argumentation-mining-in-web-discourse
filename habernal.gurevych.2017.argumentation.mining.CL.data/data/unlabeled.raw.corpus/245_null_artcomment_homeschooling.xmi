It can be successful but not under a no-oversight religious exemption like Virginia's. Some important differences were: they live in a state where all home-schooled kids take periodic competency tests to verify that satisfactory progress in each subject is being achieved. Plus parental decisions were made, each year individually for each child, whether homeschooling or public schooling would be the best fit for that particular child for the upcoming year. &#10;Their eldest son divided his years between public school and sometimes a Lutheran church school. Afterward he graduated with an excellent GPA and a double major from a highly ranked college. Another son, their youngest, arrived in their family when he was several years of age. In public school he was below grade level and he was just barely able to read so before he would have gotten frustrated and turned off in school they transitioned him to homeschooling and taught him using focused educational tecniques to help him conquer his blockages to learning to read. Not dyslexia, but some hurdles which had caused him to not learn to read as readily as others of his age. In public school, he would have had a terribly hard time catching up and to be successful in other subjects while improving his reading, even if tutored outside of class hours. After a couple of years he was ready to return to public education and was above his age level in all subjects. Without excellent, personalized homeschooling, he would not have been able to catch up and to feel competent in his school subjects. By the way, their mother had graduated with an education degree in elementary education. She was well qualified to teach and never had more than one or two of their kids homeschooled at the same time. Their eldest daughter took a few years off first then completed her college degree wholly paid by academic scholarships. Homeschools can be successful if kept accountable.
