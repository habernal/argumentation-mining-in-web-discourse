Someone like my niece, who really was ready to start kindergarten at 5 was put at a huge disadvantage because the majority of her classmates were over a year older than her. I also think it messes with the teacher's perception of where any given kid is in comparison to the rest of the class. &#10;As I said, it was suggested that my niece be held back a year at some point during the first grade. It really wasn't about her individual performance, but rather the teacher's perspective on how my niece was doing as compared to the rest of the class. Once my sister really investigated this issue, and pointed out to the teacher that her daughter was actually over a year younger than many of those kids around her (but was also the &lt;i&gt;correct&lt;/i&gt; age for her academic year), the teacher's opinion of my niece's capabilities shifted a bit. &#10;Luckily, my niece, at the time, was a bit oblivious to all of this, so there was very little impact on her self-esteem and confidence. As I said earlier, she is actually (now) one of the smartest kids in her class. Not only are her standardized test scores off the charts, but she excels within her classroom performance as well. The only area where it is still an issue is with regards to physical things - she hates gym class, and is very verbal about the fact that she is not as &quot;good&quot; at things as her peers in school. Luckily, this is not the case in the sporting activities she does outside of school, where they are regulated by age, and not what grade they are in.
