One of my grandson's has failed merseribly and is a drop out. Next month he will start in alternative school, but I don't think that will last long. I don't think any alternative schools are designed for the child who needs to learn through activity, except Montessori schools. The teaching materials for Montessori schools make use of a child's desire to manipulate and discover insights on his on own. However, this education is usually limited to children between 3 and 6 years old. &#10;I do think we need to rethink education, because one size doesn't fit all. Since 1958 education has been focused on the handful of students who will go to college. The IQ testing is limited to a narrow range of IQ, and the education is limited to this narrow range of IQ. This is a rip off for many, many students who will never succeed in this narrow of range of IQ, and will never discover where they can succeed, because their range of IQ excellence is neglected. These poor students are being cheated by public education and our society as a whole is greatly hurt by this. We have advanced technology at the expense of culture, and I think this will destroy us. &#10;Why are you so focused on literacy? May be literacy isn't the best goal of public education? What does literacy mean to you? Literate in what? Education for technology for military and industrial purpose is not about literacy, so why are you jumping up and down about literatacy as though it were the proof of the success of education? &#10;We might do better if we understood our goal is dialogue, to explore the problems and solutions together, rather than approach this subject like a debate where one wins and one looses. I have studied the history of public education for many years, and may not be the person you want to debate with. However, I am excellent source of information if you want to discuss education.
