There will be a lot of people present at these meetings, especially if there are a lot of needs to consider. &#10;My son has literally only just got his statement (in fact, I haven't even had it through the post yet, just know because I called) and he will be having an annual review in January time. At this point, we'll be transferring him on from the current pre-school, to the pre-school at the school we wish for him to attend. It might be that the school are going to require a higher level of funding (not sure what they receive right now) or that more services are needed. Or it might be just the bog standard annual review. &#10;Your friend's wishes, if she can provide good reasons (which she obviously can) will always come first, but that doesn't mean they'll make it easy on her. Is your friend in touch with the parent partnership services? You could get her to talk to them if not, people from there are on the parent's side and will attend meetings with you as that extra support.
