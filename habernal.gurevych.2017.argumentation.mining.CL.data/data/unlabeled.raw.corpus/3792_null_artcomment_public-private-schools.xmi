As a person who attended private and public, I knew before my children were born that I was going to keep them in private, but life happens and I had to send them to public one year, as a result when my oldest went back to private she had to repeat a grade, and while my youngest had a great teacher @ the public school,but the parents were telling me about their sons liking her and calling her their girlfriend, I did not like that at all. If public school were about education then I would have my children there and support it 100 percent, but its about agendas and a test. It is a broken system and that is why so many parents have opted out, and they have that right, and just because my children go to private school does not mean we have stopped paying taxes, if they do not use it for the school that is their problem not ours, if people pay taxes for the school district then that money should be used in the district not go in a education fund and only given for amount of students attending. Parents should not be quilted into wanting the best for their children and even those in leadership of our country have their children in private school. It seems that the person who wrote the article is not a parent, but it is a land of free speech so they are entitled to their opinion.
