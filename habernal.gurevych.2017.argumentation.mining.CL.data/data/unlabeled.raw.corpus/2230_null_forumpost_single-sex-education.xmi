And personally, I was always more mature than most of the other girls, too. But there's always going to be a difference of maturity between different individuals, whether male or female. &#10;I went to co-ed schools from kindergarten until the end of 9th grade. I switched to an all-girls school in the 10th grade and stayed until I finished high school. &#10;I highly recommend a co-ed school.&#10;Now, there are pros and cons for each. But I feel that the co-ed school is more &quot;natural&quot; and its pros outweigh its cons more than the all-girls school . . . &#10;But that's just my opinion.&#10;The major thing was that I always felt like the presence of boys would have made the girls far less bitchy (as they did in my co-ed school experiences). I know that seems like such a minor gripe, but trust me, you don't want to be surrounded by the bullshit girls can concoct amongst each other when there are no boys to &quot;restrict&quot; certain behaviours . . . and I actually do feel like co-ed schools develop a girl better socially and emotionally than all-girls schools, just from the mere fact that a girl will get to interact with boys on a daily basis. &#10;Another thing that I feel parents should be aware of: I personally found that girls who attend all-girls school will go out more to actually meet boys than girls in co-ed schools. What I mean by this is, girls in co-ed schools will hang out with boys from school (inside and outside of school), yes, but the fact is: they know these boys. They went to school with them. They grew up with them. Surely as a parent you'd feel more OK knowing that your daughter was with someone she knew? &#10;Whereas girls who go to all-girls schools will hang out with guys from another school (maybe their &quot;brother&quot; school), guys from the train station, the arcade . . . you get my drift. They tend to be more open to hanging out with guys they've just met – and not really knowing anything about them. Girls LIKE male attention. And if they're not getting it at school, they'll get it elsewhere. &#10;The girls at my all-girls school got drugs from the boys they knew (all outside of school, of course, as it was an all-girls school). I didn't know one person who did drugs at my co-ed high school, or know anyone who had access to drugs. But a friend in my all-girls school showed me some drugs IN school . . . &#10;My two cents."/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2381" language="en" documentId="2230" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="theshadow2010" date="2012-May-17, 11:52 pm" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://whrl.pl/RdbLr5" topic="single-sex-education" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="2230" notes="" title="Girls to Co-Ed or all girls high school"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="235"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="236" end="399"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="400" end="434"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="435" end="593"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="594" end="621"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="622" end="1177"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="63" sofa="1" begin="1178" end="1664"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="1665" end="2055"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="71" sofa="1" begin="2056" end="2367"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="75" sofa="1" begin="2368" end="2381"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59 63 67 71 75"/></xmi:XMI>
