My disability is totally different (i'm visually impaired) but I totally understand what you're saying about mainstream schooling. Sometimes it's the best thing for a child, especially if when that child becomes an adult they should be able to live independantly, but special schools do tend to be set up better for specific needs. &#10;I think mainstream primary school is really important, as long as a child can cope with it, and is able to follow the academic requirements. Secondary school can be different, purely because of the nature of the subjects. I could have coped in a mainstream secondary with the academic side of things, but I was bullied at primary school and wasn't really in a position where I'd feel at all comfortable at secondary school. But when I came back for 6th form and had had that break I wasectly ready for it, and it's the best thing i've ever done. &#10;I just hope the teachers you have to deal with will be understanding. Some are and will try their best to help, but there may well be teachers who just don't want anything to do with you, and unfortunately that makes things really complicated. &#10;Also even if everything gets sorted in lessons for Dominic, it's likely social interaction will still be difficult. That's not to say children won't be friendly, he may end up with a brilliant and really supportive group of friends, but equally there might be children who make his life hell. I know that's awful, but it does sometimes happen. The best thing to do then is be really firm with the school, because some schools try to deny it. But I wouldn't give up, if a mainstream education will benifit Dominic you should fight for it. He may take longer to make friends, but he will find people that accept him for who he is. Also, he's likely to make better friends who do genuinly care. &#10;I don't think anyone can ever settle the mainstream or special school debate because things are so different for each child, and what was appropriate at 4 or 5 may not be at 11. You just have to take each step and do what you think is best. I hope that everything goes more smoothly with the school from now on. Holly.
