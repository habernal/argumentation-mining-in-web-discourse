I also take him to the local Special School for 1 full day and and 2 half days a week. &#10;I have worked with him since reception and he will go into Y2 in September. When he is in Y2 we are going to work towards getting him a Statement. This will ensure he gets all the support he needs throughout his school career and I feel this is areally positive thing. &#10;Not all of the staff in the mainstream school think he should be there (his parents want him to be at school with his older siblings) and I sometimes find my role difficult because of this. They either don't understand his behaviour (and are unwilling to get any training) or are simply frightened of him and his behaviour can be quite unpredictable. &#10;He loves school and I think I can take credit for that. I have the support of the head in all decisions I make for him and am able to ignore and shrug off the other teacher's remarks. &#10;It make me so mad when these wonderful children are let down by their school. They call themselves teachers and caring but make no allowances for this. &#10;He also loves our visit to the Special School where he gets the specialist teaching he requires. the staff there are completely different and have welcomed us both there with open arms. &#10;I know I have waffled on a bit but I feel really strongly about this. All children should be given the opportunity to learn and be happy. &#10;By the way, the motto for the Special school is &quot;Those that mind don't matter, and those that matter don't mind&quot; how true. &#10;Hope this helps"/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1586" language="en" documentId="4884" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Louise P(725)" date="19-08-12 22:07" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://www.netmums.com/coffeehouse/advice-support-40/special-needs-disabilities-support-502/809172-fighting-keep-my-son-mainstream-school-all.html" topic="mainstreaming" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="4884" notes="" title="fighting to keep my son in mainstream school"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="160"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="161" end="430"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="431" end="782"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="783" end="967"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="968" end="1120"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="1121" end="1307"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="63" sofa="1" begin="1308" end="1446"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="1447" end="1570"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="71" sofa="1" begin="1571" end="1586"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59 63 67 71"/></xmi:XMI>
