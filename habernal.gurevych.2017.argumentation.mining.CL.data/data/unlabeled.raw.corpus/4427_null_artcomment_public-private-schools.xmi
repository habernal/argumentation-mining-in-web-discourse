Not everyone can afford to choose. There are parents who work incredibly hard but still have no choice as they don't earn enough. They will be choosing between paying bills, buying food, rent and sending their children to private schools. As for students in private schools mixing with 'better' kids, well kids will be kids. There are still issues with drugs in private schools and issues such as bullying occur across all financial and social classes. As for teaching standards - there are many, many great teachers in public education who go well above their role as a teacher to ensure their students have every opportunity to succeed at school. There are also teachers that aren't so great. But that is the same in private schools and every other profession. There is a problem with adequately resourcing public schools and those of you who can afford to make a choice should be advocating the government to provide adequate funding. It is more than about yourself - it is about giving everyone an opportunity to shine, which will make Australia a better place. Economically, it makes sense too as if it lifts people out of disadvantage and reduces the burden on social welfare.
