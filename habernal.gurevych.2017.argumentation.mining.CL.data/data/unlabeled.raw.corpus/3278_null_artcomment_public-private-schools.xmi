Enrollment in public schools are dropping, because the public schools are dumbing down our children.  If the public school system is so concerned about enrollment dropping, then they should come up with curriculum that does a better job of educating our children.  What's more, the environment of a public school tears down and destroys the self esteem of children rather than building them up. I remember as a child attending public school, I was very cross-eyed, so you can imagine the teasing I had to endure for being cross-eyed and for wearing glasses.  The teasing didn't stop until I graduated from high school.  So, are you telling me that I should expose my children to that kind of environment.    My children are grown now, but even 35 years ago, if I had it to do all over again, I'd home school my children.  There is simply too many social problems in the public schools, and I would rather not expose my children to them until they are old enough to handle it.  My children have thrived better socializing with adults, because adults uplift and encourage them, whereas the public school tears them down. What's more, most of the revenue that is intended to increase education for our children actually go to increase the fat salaries of the people in charge of the public school system or to promote sports which ought to be secondary to learning reading, writing and arithmetic.  Forget about using the revenues to give the teachers better pay and provide an environment that motivates children to want to learn. I used to think like the writer, but not any more.  I wised up.
