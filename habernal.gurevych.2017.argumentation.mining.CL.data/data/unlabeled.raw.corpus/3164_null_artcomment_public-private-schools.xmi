The reason I sent my children to a private school is that I don't agree with the garbage that is being taught in most of the public school class rooms.  A lot of what they teach goes against what we believe.  We are Christians and we don't want our children to be exposed to all the lies of evolution and everything that stems from it.   We also want our children to have the religious instruction at a private school and the overall religious overtones they receive in all the other subjects as well because they are being taught by Christians.   There isn't anything I can do to change what happens in peoples homes.  Garbage in Garbage out.  What a lot of these kids in public schools are being exposed to at home, they bring to the school and I don't want my children exposed to it.  Plain and simple.  There isn't anything I can do to bring God back into the public school and Praise God for all the Christian kids that go to public school but it isn't easy.    I am a product of both private schools and public schools and so is my wife.  My wife is a teacher and she has taught in public schools.  People have a choice and it isn't about being wealthy.  It is about making the education for your children a priority.  If you want your children to be taught by teachers that have your same morals and values then you make the sacrifice and send them to a private school.   We can't change what our government and all these special interest groups want to force the children to learn in the public schools but we can change where our children go to school.
