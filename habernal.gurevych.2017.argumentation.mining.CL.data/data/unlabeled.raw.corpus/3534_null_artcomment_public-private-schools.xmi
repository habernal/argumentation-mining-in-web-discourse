My story may be a little long but very important. My boys are 32 &amp; 30 now. Oldest was very smart and youngest had learning problems. Oldest was board at school by 6th grade. Youngest struggled . I was a stay at home mom. Oldest I begged for advanced classes. Youngest ends up in special Ed classes, and soon start talking about meds. Oldest starts running with the wrong kids. We did it all, Church camps, Sports, Band, Counseling and police trying to keep contact down with the bad kids in school. No Help. Oldest 1st year in high school I  go to the 1st parent teacher conference and find out he hasn't turn in any work nothing not even work we helped with. 9 Weeks no call no nothing. He is a popular student, teachers love him, hangs with football stars, dates cheer leaders. Very good at manipulating. Soon busted his hand. Told us and doctors it was slammed in a car trunk. 3 week later his best friend did the same. Gang Initiation. It got a lot worse over about a year. He told me once in a fight that these people will die for him. I said they will? They Will? I'm your mother I Will.  Came home from the store one day and all who was forbidden was in my house and son shoved something down the side of the coach. I walked over and pulled out a gun..  I kick him out of the house because my hole family is in danger. I call Police to tell them they were doing crack in the house they were staying at. Police couldn't do any thing say its here say. Later he gets shot in the leg. His friends run and hide. At 17 his best friend was arrested for armed robbery.    Sorry for the long story Here is the end. Youngest now 1st year in high school registration and sitting with the Principle and he is going over School Policy's. 1 to 10 he says 1st offense S. A. 2nd offence give up lunch time. 3rd offence stay after school. 4th note too Parent. and so on. I stopped him and said No you will notify every Time.  Buy the way youngest still can't read in 9th grade. He comes home from school one day and he say guess what mom? His older brothers best friend is back at school after armed robbery. Juvie was full and didn't have room for him so he was ordered by the court to go back to school. Friend is a peer now to all these kids. Youngest said this kid had 30 kids around him all day.&quot; Cool armed robbery did you shot at the cop&quot;.  I took youngest back to the school right away and said I don't want this kid in the school with my kid.   THEY SAID &quot;HE HAS A RIGHT TO BE EDUCATED&quot;. I'll never forget that. Then we are Signing youngest out of school Now.  They said &quot; You don't want to do that&quot; I said &quot;Yes I Do&quot;.  Youngest went to a private military school and learned more there in 3 years then 9 years of public school.   Youngest is a Simple &amp; Honorable man and doing well... Oldest is getting out of Prison on Sept, 11 2013   Go Private or Charted or even Online. BUT GET THE GOVERNMENT  AND THERE STUPID RULES OUT OF OUR SCHOOLS.........
