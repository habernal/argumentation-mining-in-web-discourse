I went to public schools all my life (Connecticut) and it sucked, (I am in now in my upper sixties). There was constant fighting especially in high school, the teachers could care less about how well the students were progressing unless it affected their life, our desks were jammed up to the one in front of you so you had no room to move, we were on split sessions and you always had to beg barrow or steal your school supplies, on and and on it go's and even with today's public schools nothing has changed, our children are the last to receive any funds for their needs such as paper pencils,etc. and why do we not have air conditioning in ALL their school bus's as well as the schools, we have it in our homes and cars (do you as an adult purchase a new car without AC?) And why our children are not able to have a HOT LUNCH (really p-s----s me off) at no cost for whatever their reason is for not having their lunch money (just give it to them with no questions asked, by way of a voucher for ALL students. I remember when the lottery was put in place and was approved ONLY because all profits were to completely go towards educating our children, and where is all the money going from our SCHOOL tax bill we see every year when we receive our tax bill. I could go on and on about our PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM in all states. Let me just say this, if you can afford to send your child to private school or better yet home school them, by all means go for it. Oh by the way why is it teachers as well as other well educated individuals constantly refer to CHILDREN as &quot;KIDS&quot;, the last I knew a kid was a goat. Typical PUBLIC SCHOOL education.
