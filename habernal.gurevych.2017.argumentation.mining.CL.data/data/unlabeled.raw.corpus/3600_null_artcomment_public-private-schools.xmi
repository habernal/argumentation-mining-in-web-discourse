Also, not every parent wants to be a crusader for the public school system. Why should *I* have to spend a significant part of my time trying to get improvements to a public school system done?  Why should *I* have to work harder for my child to get a better education?  Why should my CHILD have to work harder to get the same benefits out of an inferior school system?   The problem with education in this country is caused by a multitude of things.  Costs are out of control because you can't raise the public school cost to compensate teachers better and private schools won't endanger their bottom line to allow a wider range of people to attend.    The culture is also messed up because we have this driving need to lavish attention on every child because we don't want anyone to get &quot;left behind&quot; when it is a fact of nature that not everyone has the same needs.  The gifted students get bottled up while the less gifted still struggle to keep up, there isn't an easy solution.   Part of the problem is we are competing with nations (like Japan)  who treat education as a priviledge and not a right.  Where you need to excel to attend upper levels of school and only those likely to suceed are allowed to go.  They don't have a prejudice against manual labor and manufacturing jobs, and they shouldn't.  There isn't anything wrong with working in a skilled labor career (plumber, electrician, carpenter, machinist, etc).    Until we realize that not everyone should go to college, and not everyone is a bright shining genius, we won't fix anything. Not to mention that we have a ton of teachers, many of whom are beaten down in their early years by excessive hours, parents who expect the world without wanting to put forth any effort themselves and low pay.  I am very glad I never wanted to teach...
