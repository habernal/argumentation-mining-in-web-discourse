What this writer does not discuss and as usual it is the same argument people want to avoid.  The problem is not money and overall funding because city, state and federal funds have poured in for decades and yet the public school system is apparently still soup. Do you have some teachers that should not be teaching? yes, but that is the case in any industry.  Overall, the teachers are fine.  The problem is the homes from which these kids are being raised.  For example, if a black teen ager pays attention in school he or she, but more often he will get railed by his boys for being smart and trying to be white. Also, it is more cool in school to act stupid and act like a gangsta.  If all these kids went to school, sat down and applied themselves and the teachers did not feel like they need to carry guns to the class room then the school system would run fine. I myself being white grew in Dorchester Mass back in the 70's during the bussing riots.  I was an inner city kid and was bussed from Dorchester to Jamaica Plain which was an all black inner city neighborhood just like where I came from in Dorchester.  If I went to the bathroom, I got jumped, my sister was in fights after school which made me jump in and always lose because I was always outnumbered by the guys who jumped in against me. The flip side is before bussing I went to public school in my neighborhood and paid attention in class and did fine.  Eventually, I quit school because of all the BS, not the teachers but all the BS. Joined the military, acquired a GED and now have an MBA with a concentration in technology management with zero federal assistance. Schools are not the problem, money will not fix it.  The problem is at home and the lack of discipline these little morons have in today's society. They actually think its cool to be stupid.  We are not lacking in math and science skills because public schools do not know what they doing.  We are lacking because parents or lack of parents have instilled zero ethics and discipline in today's kids. However, let's not discuss that.  Let's not the discuss the real internal cultural issues that are causing that.  Nope, it is much easier to blame the people who do those things and ensure their kids follow those rules. Then you have the problem with so many young black men growing up fatherless. Sorry, but I do not believe this is because of racism.  I believe this is a cultural issue within the black community they need to fix them selves.  I'm lying? Do you watch the NBA and NFL? How come the majority of thanks some of these black players give is to either their mother or grandmother and not their father? Because dad was there when they were coming up.  However, they were lucky, but all the so called gangsta's who only have their home boys to look up to end up in jail instead of paying attention in school. The reality is not the public school system.  The reality is this country refuses to address real problems because sometimes those real problems are too ugly to address so it is easier to blame another part of society for the problem.
