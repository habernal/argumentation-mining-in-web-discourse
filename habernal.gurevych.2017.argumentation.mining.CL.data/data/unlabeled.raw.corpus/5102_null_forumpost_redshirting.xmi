She actually wasn't academically advanced at all. She was pretty average for her age I suppose. She wasn't reading when she started, but she did know the letters and what sounds they made, could write her name, etc. &#10;The difference was she was very socially mature. She could sit a whole day and listen nicely to the teacher, move to her centers, follow directions 100%, got along well with everyone and was popular in the class, considerate and kind. &#10;Her preschool teachers said they saw no reason to hold her back, since it would be &quot;just to be the oldest one&quot; as though its ALWAYS better to be the oldest (which isn't true). I just could not imagine her sitting there another year in Pre-K with the wild kids not listening and running around. The children a year behind in her preschool just seemed SO much younger than she was. She didn't seem like she'd fit in. &#10;Now - is she a superstar academically? Nope, she's pretty average. I've heard people comment that I should have held her back - I suppose so my Special Snowflake could artificially be the highest performing child by dint of being older than everyone else. BUT - honestly? Do I think she'd be the best? No - I actually think she's so mature that she pushes herself UP to to the higher performers. She's a little naturally lazy and lackadaisical. Being with kids much younger - she might actually lower herself to those standards and not try as hard. I really believe that. &#10;No teacher has said she should have been held back by the way."/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1543" language="en" documentId="5102" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Bigmouthstrikesagain" date="04/03/2012" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://community.babycenter.com/post/a32503567/yet_another_redshirting_debate?cpg=4" topic="redshirting" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="5102" notes="" title="Yet another redshirting debate"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="255"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="256" end="491"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="492" end="907"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="908" end="1480"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="1481" end="1543"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55"/></xmi:XMI>
