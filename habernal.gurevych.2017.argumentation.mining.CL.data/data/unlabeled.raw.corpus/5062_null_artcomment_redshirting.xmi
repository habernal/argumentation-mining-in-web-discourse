There aren't enough classes in each individual school to do that until they hit the middle school level (which is 6th grade here). I think eventually other areas will have to do what Chicago did - which is to force the parents to start the kid in first grade at the age of 6 (unless, of course, there is a professionally documented recommendation to hold them back). It really is getting that ridiculous. &#10;Rebecca, I hope that it goes well with your boys. As I said, this whole issue was why, even at Molly's tender age, I didn't try to push her into the 3 y/o program even though I knew she was more than capable of excelling in it. I didn't want her to be two years younger than a bulk of her class. It's just too much of an age difference when they are this young. &#10;In retrospect, I was also a fall birthday, and one of the younger kids in my class (the cutoff was December 31st back then). Like my niece, I struggled a bit in kindergarten and first grade, and then it all seemed to even out for me, and I was then one of the &quot;smart&quot; kids. It's funny, but I vividly remember thinking that the smart kids were automatically always tall. I just didn't realize that it was because they were, for the most part, almost a year older than me! Because of the change in the cut-off date, she will be starting kindergarten at almost a full year older than I did.
