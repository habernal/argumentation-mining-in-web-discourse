She fails to realize that many people usually first send their child to public school only to come to the realization that many of the public schools are a disastrous place for their child to be in.  Though some of the schools have a good education, they may still have a lot of other issues, like crime, bullying, and basically bad influences.  Many of these parents try to get involved, but to no avail in actually making a real difference.  This is when many parents pull their child from public schools.  Look, the schools are getting worse and worse due to children and other parents not being held accountable for their actions.  Children get a slap on their wrist and many parents think that their child is a little angel when in fact they are a big tyrant.      In addition, the school districts are being overrun by immigrants while our taxes keep going up to pay for more teachers, bigger schools, etc.  And remember, many of these immigrants don't come with the same cultural respect as did the Europeans years ago.  This doesn't mean all immigrants are hurting the system.  It just means that there are more immigrants allowed into this country today, which doesn't allow for them to assimilate to our country, and for use to absorb the temporary strain that they put on the system.  Instead, we start to be forced to become like them.  This causes the country to become weaker as time goes on instead of becoming stronger. Ms. Benedikt these parents aren't bad, maybe you are just ignorant to the real issues in the school districts.  I taught for the last 20 years and I can tell you that the schools are becoming a more difficult place to send your children.  Maybe if more parents could afford to send their child to private schools the government would get a clue and start changing to laws in this country to protect and allow respect for the teachers again.  This country is currently in a dangerous place and it only seems to be getting worse instead of better.  Don’t blame the parents, blame the politicians.
