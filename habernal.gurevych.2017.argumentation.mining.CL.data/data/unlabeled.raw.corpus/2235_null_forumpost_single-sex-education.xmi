The overwhelming feeling I get is that you can not generalize and everyone has a different experience. It does depend on the child, the school, the teacher, and the other kids in the class. We had another long conversation last night with my wife, and came to the conclusion that the oldest would cope easily in both schools, and so would the youngest although she is not as extroverted. She is clever, confident and willing to take on &quot;everything&quot; so we've started to hone in on the different school programs. Either way we can't go wrong both are great schools. I can see her putting boys in their place, she has a lot of natural leadership about her, so thanks for your feedback. I guess the answer is to go back to the child and assess their capabilities and match them with the school environment as best you can. You coming from migrant parents who at th etime could not speak the language and having to &quot;fend for myself&quot; through school I at least want to &quot;be the parent that makes an informed decision&quot;. As I was tucking my daughter in last night (she still let's me) like every ohter night this week, she tells me to sit down so we can chat and her first question is &quot;So, have you made a decision? and I reply, what about you? She is as torn as we are after having been to both school tours and presntations, I guess she is waiting for us to show the way. Thanks again.
