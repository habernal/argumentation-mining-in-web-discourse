We also have a duty, maybe it's not clearly legislated anywhere but it's still a duty, to provide our children with a suitable diet and clothes. Government inspectors don't come door to check our kitchens and wardrobes, demanding menu plans for the next year, but there are powers to investigate and intervene where there is REASON to believe that parents are starving, malnourishing and otherwise neglecting their children. Can you truly not see the difference between investigating individual cases with cause and investigating everyone as standard? &#10;If that's the case how on earth will monitoring of home educators work? Do you SERIOUSLY think that the state would send in inspectors who would just shrug their shoulders if a child isn't reading by a set age? Oh well, never mind, your kid is a sows ear? Not a chance! &#10;Frankly I don't buy your argument for school children anyway, only a TINY minority are so mentally challenged that they can't become literate, for most it IS a failure in the education they have been provided with. An education that really IS suitable to the age, ability, aptitude and any special educational needs of an individual child WILL result in functional literacy in all but that tiny minority. Just look at the one-to-one tuition pilots that the DCSF are so proud of. A few hours really working with a child can make a massive difference and when that doesn't happen shouldn't the school, the LA and the state be held to account? &#10;YAWN! You are missing the point with your comparisons, I'm not asking anyone to employ me. School teachers are employed, often at public expense, and therefore it is reasonable to scrutinise them, although recently even that seems to be getting a bit out of hand, they do have SOME right to privacy in their private lives after all. Parenting is a private family matter. Children are NOT yet the property of the state with their parents little more than unpaid minders doing the bidding of the government of the day. Educating our children IS important, far too important to leave to career bureaucrats and social engineers.
