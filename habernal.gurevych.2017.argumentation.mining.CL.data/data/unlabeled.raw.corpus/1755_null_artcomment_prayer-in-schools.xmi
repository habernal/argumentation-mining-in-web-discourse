Easy as that. It is offensive to Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Atheists, etc. That’s like if Muslim became the predominant religion in America suddenly and they decided that they should pray muslim prayers every day but not the others. It’s offensive. So what if our nation was built on Christianity? Our fore fathers and some of our greatest leaders where ATHEIST. Sure they used the term “God” a lot and carried around bibles but that’s because it was the custom of the day. Even the great Abraham Lincoln was an atheist. Lincoln said, quote, “While a higher power may exist, I do not bow down to it.” All you Christians go crazy over prayer not being in public schools. Get over it. We made that unconstitutional a long time ago. If your kid wants to pray, then they can do it quietly to himself/herself. Things like this is the answer to your famous question “Why does everyone bash us? What did we ever do to deserve the bashing we get?” You get bashed because you try to force your religious ideals down everyone’s throat. You want to end abortion, which is a woman’s right. You want to pretty much abolish the teaching of evolution OR want them to teach both evolution and Creation claiming that Creation can be taught in a non-religious context. Not at all. God is mentioned in the Creation story, it is religious. You bash atheists/agnostics all the time but when they turn around to bash back, you act like you’re the victim. You completely somehow forget about the bashing you did. God is on the money, he’s in the Pledge of Allegiance, and many other things. Are you happy with that? No. You believe that because our nation was built on Christian Principles is the only proof you need to validate the bringing of prayer back to public schools. Are you trying to make people dislike you more? Look, I’m Catholic but I’m a loose Catholic. I don’t believe that prayer should be spoken aloud as a rule in Public Schools. I don’t believe in elimating evolution and teaching the BS “Adam and Eve” story. I believe that while abortion is bad in most cases, a women shouldn’t have to give birth to a baby that is the product of rape or incest. So, in conclusion, keep your prayer to yourselves.
