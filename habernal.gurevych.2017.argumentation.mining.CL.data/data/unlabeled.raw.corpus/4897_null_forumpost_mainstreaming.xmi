Schools will try to fund additional adults as much as possible, but budgets are unbelievably tight as it is. You also have to consider the effect that it will have on the remaining children in the class. &#10;That said however, I believe that the LA have a responsibility to provide an appropriate school place and the funding if necessary. there are emergency SEN budgets that the LA can dish out in an emergency until a statement has been either allocated or denied. Perhaps ask one of the schools if they have the appropriate number and speak to some one at the LA about this, or perhaps your local CAHMs department may be able to point you in the correct direction. &#10;I taught a new starter with Autism who was initially denied a place in my class due to him being the 3rd child with autism, and no additional funding for extra adults. We were then allocated the funding by the LA for an adult for 1 term to settle him in, and were able to take him. In that time the school were able to apply for a statement. &#10;This was certainly the procedure in Lewisham and Southwark. Good luck.&#10;ps - I think the school have to state the reason why they are unable to take that child - e.g. not safe for the child/rest of the class, complex needs, physical issue like toileting etc. Basically they had to have a very good reason for not taking the child x "/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1634" language="en" documentId="4897" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="alison f(261)" date="28-11-11 20:36" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://www.netmums.com/coffeehouse/advice-support-40/special-needs-disabilities-support-502/683875-can-mainstream-school-refuse-admit-child-sen-all.html" topic="mainstreaming" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="4897" notes="" title="Can a mainstream school refuse to admit a child with sen?"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="497"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="498" end="959"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="960" end="1302"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="1303" end="1373"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="1374" end="1634"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55"/></xmi:XMI>
