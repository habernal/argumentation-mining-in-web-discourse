My ODD is in 8th grade currently, and there is a girl in ydd's 6th grade class who is at least a couple months older than my 8th grader. &#10;When ODD started school we lived in an area/district with a Dec cut-off and red shirting was pretty much unheard of. ODD met the K expectations at 3 and was more than ready to start school at 4. K was only 1/2 day and she was bored to tears as it was. She came home and learned academics; school was there for her to learn the rules and social things that go with being in a classroom. As it was, being bored in school for many years didn't do her any favors. &#10;When she was 1/2 way through 1st grade we moved to an area with a Sept 1 cut-off. Her class had virtually no summer birthdays who were sent on time. All kids with late May and after birthdays were held out meaning that she was significantly younger than the next youngest person in her class. Had we lived here when she was in K I would have had to find a way to have her in private school all along I'm sure. Now we are hoping for her to get into a Science and Math institute for next year; she's on the waiting list.
