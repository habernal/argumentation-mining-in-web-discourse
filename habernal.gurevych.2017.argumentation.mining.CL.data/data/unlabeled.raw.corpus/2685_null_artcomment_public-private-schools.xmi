Feel free to have your opinion and feel free to share it, but don't call the people who choose differently or believe differently &quot;bad people&quot;. Secondly, you are making an assumption that granted, many people make, but is just not true: all people who go to private school can afford private school.  I went to private school and I needed scholarships; I had a lot of friends at private school whose parents worked VERY HARD to make sure they could stay there - kids got scholarships, parents got loans etc.  I think it is very rude to call those people &quot;bad people&quot;. I understand the argument behind the name-calling, and I do agree that the public education system in this country needs a massive overhaul, but telling people they made the wrong decision for their children is definitely not the way to get support.  Additionally, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, there are 50.1 million students attending public elementary and secondary schools.  There are only 5.2 million students who attend private elementary and secondary schools ().  What about the parents of those 5.2 million students makes them more capable of bringing about change than the parents of the 50.1 million students already attending public school? And PLEASE do not say their money, because not all parents who send their children to private school have a lot of disposable income and I can guarantee that there are people who do have disposable income who choose to send their children to public school.  It is wrong to call people who send their children to private school &quot;bad people&quot;. Don't blame the decay of the public school system on them. I might just as well call the parents who send their children to public school 'bad people' because clearly they haven't done enough to fix the public education system for their children. But I won't call them 'bad people' because they aren't.  They are most likely people who want to do the best they can for their children, whatever that means for them.
