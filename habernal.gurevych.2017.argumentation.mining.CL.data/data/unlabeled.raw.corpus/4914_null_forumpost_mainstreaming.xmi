When I was at school a boy had SN... can't think of the name of it... he had a much taller head and he told me last time I saw him when we were chatting a couple of years ago that it also causes fluid to build up on his brain so he has to have a drain in. I think for him Mainstream was the right choice just not THAT mainstream school... as the school we went to was absolutely awful and some kids were completely vile to the poor lad... but if he'd been in the school the girls go to I think he would have had a brilliant primary education! Not sure how his secondary school went as we went to different secondary schools and I never asked him about it. &#10;At the girls school theres a downs syndrome girl but not sure how they teach her as I don't think she's in the classroom with the other children cos she'd be in with Serena if she was... I can't really comment tho as I really don't know her situation and how bad her condition is. &#10;I worked in a SN school for work experience at 16 yrs and again when I was doing my child care course. And I have to say for the children we had there SN school was DEFINETELY the way to go. Not only could they not manage in a mainstream school but also in the SN school we were much better equiped for them and they needed different kinds of stimulation... when in a mainstream school they are trying to teach them to read and right it's completely different aims for SN children... or the more severely SN children.... &#10;So it really depends on the child and the school!"/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1553" language="en" documentId="4914" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Elizabeth m(2)" date="02-04-10 23:46" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://www.netmums.com/coffeehouse/general-coffeehouse-chat-514/news-current-affairs-topical-discussion-12/405944-special-needs-children-mainstream-schools-all.html" topic="mainstreaming" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="4914" notes="" title="Special Needs children in Mainstream Schools"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="699"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="700" end="981"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="982" end="1503"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="1504" end="1553"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51"/></xmi:XMI>
