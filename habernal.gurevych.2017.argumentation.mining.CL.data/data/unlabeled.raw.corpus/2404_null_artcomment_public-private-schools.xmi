If students have behavior issues that are counter productive to a learning environment then they must understand the rules for learning are definite and with sound reasoning for creating them.  If they do not comply then they must face consequences of non compliance. That is why they have a student hand book and policies to help with the governing of student behavior on campus.     Again, you stating that failure is still in the equation.  That means the public educations weakness is that it is failing and these students are being left behind.  Those kids have made choices.  Then they must live up to their own choices.  That is fair.  That is the American Dream.)   The leaving of these kids to private schools is because private schools don't have to focus on complying to non acceptable behavior because it is the rule of day.  Simply, parents have to make the choice and they are being good parents for thinking of and making plans for their children that will benefit them in their career oriented futures.  The bases of education is to prepare students to become productive citizens and responsible community leaders so that the greater good of all who live in their areas have common goals and common outcomes to self reliance, self respect, self contributing to themselves and to their community.   To those schools who are simply going thru the motion of teaching for teaching sake, they have lost their goals, their visions and their real purpose for public education. Allowing behavior in class rooms, halls, and events that are self destructive, abusive or thug like, then those schools have dumbed down their ideals to give into social and local pressures of the lowest forms. There is just too much wrong with schools that can not set goals that are in complement with parents values.  When the school looks like something from a degenerate society and the kids turn out as graduates for crime, then those institutions have failed miserably.
