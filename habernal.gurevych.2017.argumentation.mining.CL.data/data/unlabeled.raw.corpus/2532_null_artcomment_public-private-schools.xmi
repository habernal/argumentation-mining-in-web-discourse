There are so many arguments against what she is saying, I don't know where to start.  First of all, people who send their children to private school pay twice--taxes for public school and then again for tuition.  Thus, if the schools in the town where they live were well run, there would be no need for tuition.  The government decides how good the education is in some cases.  In our state, the legislature is always screwing around with what is offered. For example, the legislature in Washington State decided freshmen no longer need to take History.  Thus, students will have less time to learn to take notes and outline, less time to practice writing papers and doing research, and less time to learn about important historical events.  The schools have no control over what the government decides to do.  California either does or is trying to make it mandatory that all teachers teach the exact same page in the book on the exact same day--no matter what the subject.  Great minds in work there.     Private schools who don't take money from the government have more control over what to teach their students.  My son went to private school and was given Algebra in 2nd grade because he was advanced in math.  See if you can get a 2nd grade teacher in public school to care enough about your child to give him/her advanced work.  Also, all children at that school were taught to read using the &quot;SPA&quot; (self-pronouncing alphabet).  The inventor of that system tried to get it approved in California schools, but of course, the legislature there declined.  Every kindergarten student taught to read using that method could read anything by Christmas--after one semester of learning.  Not bad.  Can your public school make that claim?  Can all of the students in your public school even read by high school? Socially, there are many problem children who attend schools--a la school shootings, rapes in schools, and other terrible tragedies occur there.  Private schools aren't exempt from those problems, I'm sure, but with a smaller population, there is better supervision and a better chance of your student surviving school.  Students, from homes where the parents are more educated and committed to their children learning, get a more focused education.  I could go on and on, but I don't have the time.  I wish you lots of luck with your public school education, lady.  As for me . . . we sacrificed big time to send our kids to private school, and my children have all thanked me as adults for allowing them to get a great education.
