A no strings attached national funding that does not mandate local schools to be beholding to Washington politicians. &#10;All local schools should be controlled by those who they educate and by those who benefit from that education. Local property taxes are fast becomming the pariah of education because local communities can't fund the local schools from local property taxes alone. As much as 70% of local municpal budgets go to school funding leaving little left over for other local necessities. It is perhaps time to fund education completely on a state or national level to assure that all schools get equal funding. &#10;That said, it is also time to allow parents school choice. If this were to happen on a national basis, then the good schools would flourish and the failed schools would wither away. &#10;I have showed in my previous posts how more money doesn't translate to better education. Schools in DC proved this. The utter failure of the Democrats in their rule of DC proves they don't have the solutions to failed government schools, gun control, and to the drug problems in society. The Democrats have ruled single handedly in DC for over 30 years and what has changed??? Nothing. These problems have become even worse. This proves their solutions aren't working. And if they haven't worked in 30 years, how long must we wait to expect success? Both Republicans, and more so Democrats, have proved themselves to be failures when addressing these issues, particularly in education and in the drug abuse problems in society.
