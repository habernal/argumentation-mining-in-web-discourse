The GED system doesn't focus very much on moderation of portfolios.&#10;IIRC the department of education is literally scrapping the portfolio requirements for GED teachers this year. &#10;This means that term and year marks can be thumb sucked by teachers.&#10;I personally had a teacher from a GED school brag in my face that he regularly thumb sucks marks for kids! I was dumb struck. &#10;All private schools using the IEB system have to have proof for every single mark that is given to a child. &#10;This is done in the form of portfolios that the teachers create and have on hand for each and every student they teach. &#10;It contains all the work the students have done as well as their marks for every assignment.&#10;The IEB perform an annual audit (and moderation) of these portfolios by selecting a few portfolios out of each class for each subject from each school in the country. &#10;This is a huge workload on the teachers but it's the only way to have an audit trail of assignments and marks allocated to the assignments. &#10;If the school or teachers have been thumb sucking marks then there are dire consequences.&#10;2. IEB matriculants have preference over GED matriculants when applying for university entrance. &#10;IEB matriculants are placed at the top of the list.&#10;This is illegal and universities will not acknowledge that it happens but it does!&#10;So if you want your kid's application to be placed on the top of the pile, pick IEB.&#10;3. The IEB is a far superior education system to the GED. They are not even close to the same level. &#10;This can be witnessed by the fact that IEB matriculants have a much easier time adjusting to the workload at tertiary institutions than GED matriculants. &#10;My wife and I were going to send our kids to a good model C school but after seeing what is going on in the GED system we've decided to rather squeeze the wallet and put them in private schools. &#10;It has nothing to do with social status - I'd rather save the money and not have to battle to make ends meet. &#10;It has every thing to do with giving my kids a good start in life, a higher chance of university entrance and therefore a better chance at landing a decent job. &#10;With AA/BEE stacked against my kids I need to ensure that they are at the top of the list when it comes to employment opportunities.
