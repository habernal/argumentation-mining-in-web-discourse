But then, not surprising as there were lots of similar comments on articles aorund the time of the Badman review into HE under the last government. &#10;For the sake of anyone reading with an open mind:&#10;- HE in this country is not primarily religiously-motivated. This may have been more true in America, but less so now as the numbers have grown. Are there religious HEers? Sure, but the idea that it's all about fundamentalist isolationists with foil hats hiding from the world is, frankly, a pretty childish strawman... - You don't need to be a teacher, or rich, or live in a particular area, although of course your surroundings determine what's going on around you, but this is equally true if you use schools - You don't need to follow the National Curriculum, or indeed any curriculum. People follow a diverse range of approaches, from mirroring the school pedagogy and curriculum, through to shorter intense lessons, or using tutors, or following the child's own interests and being more of a facilitator than teacher, or any combination on that spectrum - The 'home' of 'home education' is a misnomer, as children, like adults, can learn anywhere / any time by exploring and engaging with the world around them, pursuing interests and learning skills, working at their own pace and engaging with people of all ages and backgrounds - Rough estimates suggest approx around 50000 HEers in the UK, so about 1% of children. There are numerous groups and meet-ups for HE kids all over the country, plus all of the groups and activities open to all children, and there's no reason for HE kids to be lacking in social life with other HE kids and of course their school-attending peers on hand. The world does stretch beyond 30 other children in a classroom... The HE'ed children I know, ranging from 2 to 18, are diverse, confident, happy and articulate with a wide circle of friends of all ages - Loads of forums, email lists, and Facebook groups for parents to chat, share ideas and resources, etc - Would suggest looking at John Holt, Alan Thomas, Paula Rothermel, Ivan Illich for further background. There's also loads of websites with more info. &#10;Best not to believe the negative spin thrown around by the PTB or some of the more bigoted commenters above, and make your own informed decision as to what is going to work best for your child and your family, which of course is what all parents strive to do.
