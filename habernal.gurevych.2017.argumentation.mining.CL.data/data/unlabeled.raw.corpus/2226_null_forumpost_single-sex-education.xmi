Although I was bullied by a lot of girls, I'm sure that could have happened in a co-ed school. I found a nerdy group – there will always be one – and we were our own safe space. &#10;And boys aren't some sort of weird creature you need 12 years of training to be able to talk to. They're just people. It's not that hard. &#10;Now, I am 5 years out of school and may have forgotten just how awkward around boys I was during high school &amp; first year uni. Or maybe it's just that it really didn't matter in the context of life! I've found wonderful guy friends and boyfriends that my parents were delighted to meet (reassure your paranoia :p). Partly forced on me by doing male-dominated courses though (engineering). And throughout high school and uni I engaged in a mixed sport so that probably helped. &#10;My younger sisters both went to co-ed schools and enjoyed them, but so far they are the ones who have trouble with guys. &#10;I suspect that single-sex schools have particular advantages for more academically inclined girls. Or more accurately, I remember suspecting this during a long run after reading this thread, but I can't actually remember why I suspected this.
