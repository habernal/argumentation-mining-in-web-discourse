I don't know any home educators that are doing so for religious reasons. Religion might have been a popular reason once, but it isn't at the moment. I'd say popular reasons now include poor school performance, bullying, government meddling. &#10;To all those whingeing about lack of socialisation, stop and think. Most home educators meet up with others and the children get used to playing with other children of all ages and being in the real world. Compare this to being stuck for several hours a day in a classroom where you're not supposed to be talking to the children around you (seeing as children are in school to learn, not to socialise), and who are all your own age. Plenty of people complain that the young don't know how to talk to adults and are alienated from society. In general, home educated children fare better because they do learn how to interact with adults. Schoolchildren get to interact with a few teachers for much of the time, so have very limited contact with adults. Many schoolchildren will tell you that it is possible to be very alone in a class of 20-30 children if you don't fit in with the crowd. &#10;As for parents being able to provide an adequate education, they don't need to know a subject, but to be able to facilitate resources to enable the child to learn (teaching and learning are not the same thing). I still have one of my school reports where the teacher states that he thought I was learning more from my own reading that I did in his classroom. This was in a subject (chemistry) about which my parents knew nothing. &#10;The most valuable thing you can impart to a child is how to learn. Once they've mastered that, they are well-equipped to fill in any gaps and adapt to changing circumstances. Schools fail at this big-time because learning to learn is not part of the National Curriculum and so gets strangled by all the red tape.
