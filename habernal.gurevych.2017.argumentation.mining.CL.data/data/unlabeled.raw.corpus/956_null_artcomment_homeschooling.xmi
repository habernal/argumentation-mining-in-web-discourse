This means the state either provides that education or scrutinises those who do. The Education Act 1996 states: The parent of every child of compulsory school age shall cause him to receive efficient full time education suitable: 1.to his age, ability and aptitude; 2.to any special educational needs he may have, either by regular attendance at school or otherwise. &#10;The state therefore, by legislating has the responsibility to ensure that parents are fulfilling their legal obligation. &#10;Nonsense. The fact a child hasn't learned to read does not mean an education has not been provided. All children are different, some are less capable, some will never grasp certain things, they simply aren't capable, you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, if a child has an IQ of 70, they will never excell academically, in the same way that a child with one leg will never win an olympic gold for the 100m. &#10;No, I mean what I say. Are you perhaps psychic?&#10;Oh dear. Paranoia. It is not criminalising. It is exercising control over something which is important. What you can't have is optional control which those who auto asses themselves as not needing can opt out of. That is ridiculous. Is scrutinising the ability of a would be driver before allowing him to drive an invasion of privacy? Is scrutinising the skill of a doctor or a school teacher before letting them loose to practice their trade an invasion of privacy. And yet when it comes to something as important as educating one's own children, suddenly even the most incompetent soul requires no control??? Very strange point of view indeed.
