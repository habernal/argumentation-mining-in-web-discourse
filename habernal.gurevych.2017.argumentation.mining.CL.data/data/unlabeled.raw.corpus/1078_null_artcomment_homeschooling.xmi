Straight &quot;A&quot;s at GCSEs, a place at college and briming with confidence and social skills - I'm sorry if we don't fit the stereotype. Oh, and yes - fit, healthy and plenty of friends. Anyone who thinks school is the only place to learn social skills and acquire friends really hasn't given it much thought. Then again, most of the negative commenters here don't appear to have thought about it at all before their fingers hit the keyboard. They may know nothing about it - but they're resolutely agin it... &#10;It was hard work sometimes. No help or advice from official sources (&quot;An old, used copy of the National Curriculum? Certainly, that will be £50...&quot;) - and you wouldn't believe the effort needed to try and find a school gracious enough to take a lot of our money just to get in an extra exam paper for an external candidate. We ended up with a 90 minute drive each way for every test or exam. But we did it. It worked. We're happy. &#10;I find this new approach of &quot;presumed child molester unless proven otherwise to Social Services&quot; a very sick turn of events. Government is already trying to make all home ed course work be done in a school, in case parents help the child - which is going to make the bureacratic burden and the cost even higher. &#10;How can we be so tolerant of different religions and different cultures, but anyone educating their child at home must be trouble and deserves to be condemned?
