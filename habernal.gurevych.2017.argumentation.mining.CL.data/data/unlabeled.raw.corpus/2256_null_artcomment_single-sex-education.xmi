Some believed that it would be a good source for boys to be seperated from girls because the two gender's learning techniques are enhanced in differet enviornments. For instance boys may like a loud environment, while girls would like a more gentlier feel. Then there were some who believed if we go into single-sex education gender sterotypes would increase again. But overall there is no scientific evidence to support single sex-education, so therefore it cant be enforced in public school systems unwillingly. &#10;This relates to our course topic on segregation. If single sex-education would come into play now in this time of day,it would backfire on those pioneers that worked hard to put the different sexes together. It could possibly put women back in the mind-frame that men are superior to them. It could provide lack of communication skills with the opposite sex, as well as a rise in homo-sexuality. &#10;This topic illustrates the complex relatiosnhips between urban schools and society by showing how people still beleive that there is more power in seperating us rather than trying to unite us as one. Just like people believed separating whites from blacks was more productive, because they beleived different races werent capable to learn on the same level. Which i believed has been an ignorant way to think, and thankfully we been proved skeptic's wrong on that note. &#10;I choose this topic because i thought it was interesting that people still believe boys and girls are not capable to be on the same intellectual level as one another. Despite our gender of course we think differntly thats apart of being an individual, but give us the problem 1+1, boy or girl would still provide the same answer (2).
