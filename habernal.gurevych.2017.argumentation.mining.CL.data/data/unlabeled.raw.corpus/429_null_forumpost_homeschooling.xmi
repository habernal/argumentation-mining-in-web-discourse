Honestly, I think public school is a one size fits all system that's too heavily focused on teaching kids how to take tests as oppose to how to deal with actual situations in the real world. &#10;How beneficial homeschooling is depends on the parents. Some parents let education fall the sidelines, some parents who let education take over their child's life. For the most part, I think it's better than public school though. It's easier for the parents to learn what fits their child's individual educational needs, as oppose one adult who's going to see this child among 20 other students for only one year. &#10;A lot of my mom's friends have told us that they feel my parents aren't preparing me for the real world, that I won't be prepared for bullies and other mean people. The thing is, when I was in the public school some of the bullies were teachers, not to mention the middleschool mean girls. All I learned about bullies in that environment is that if I stay quiet and let them walk all over me maybe, just maybe I'll be safe. Since I've been homeschooled I've been able to gain confidence in myself that allows me to stand up to people when I feel they've overstepped my boundaries. &#10;I've some homeschoolers who others might be considered weird or sheltered.The thing is, I've met kids that are like that who go to public school, so while sometimes it may be because their homeschooled, a lot of the times I don't think that has anything to do with it.
