I also watched the segment on 60 Minutes last night, and while I understand every parent’s wish to advocate and do their best for their child, I’m not sure that red-shirting really gives them an advantage in life. Having lived overseas and seen our toddlers becoming perfectly bilingual as they learned to speak, it really showed me how much their little brains can cope with at an early age… and how ripe they are for learning. Why waste that time? &#10;In Europe, where I grew up, we were packed off to kindergarten at the age of 3, so there was no way I was waiting until my own kids were 5 or 6 (plus they would have driven me completely crazy by then). They were all late babies (Sep, Oct, Jan), have all been amongst the youngest in their classes, yet have all excelled academically. They appear to have normal social relationships and are talented athletes who have regularly made the ‘A’ teams. But maybe I’ve just been lucky. Or maybe I wasn’t too worried about an NHL career in any of their futures. &#10;I myself (a November baby) have gone through life being the “young one” in many situations, and I have to admit that I liked it. It can often feel like an advantage to be younger than your peers, especially when it comes to succession planning! &#10;One final thought: As I was voicing my opinion to the segment last night, my husband pointed out, “In my day nobody wanted to be held back a year as it meant you weren’t smart.” Hmmm, good point.
