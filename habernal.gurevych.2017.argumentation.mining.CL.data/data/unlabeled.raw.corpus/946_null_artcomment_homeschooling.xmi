This is no doubt one element in the equation but by no means the only one, although it is the one which probably best serves her agenda to stir up the indignation of the knee jerk brigade. &#10;The proposals basically impose a greater scrutiny and accountability on home schooling. And rightly so, parents do not have the right to choose to deprive their children of an academic education any more than they have the right to deprive their child of &quot;proper&quot; healthcare. I think we would all agree that if a parent takes a child with cancer to a faith healer but refuses conventional medicine, then intervention would be necessary. Or is it better to let the child die in the name of respecting the parents' right to privacy? &#10;What is wrong with requiring parents who wish to educate their children at home to have qualifications, to be teaching a core of academic knowledge? If a child is not being provided with the academic grounding necessary then it is someones business, and parents can not be the only judges of what is good for their children because, frankly, some parents are not fit to judge. &#10;At the end of the day, if parents are afraid of scrutiny, then one would ask why? If they are capable of teaching, and providing the knowledge necesary for their children, then they should have no problem justifying this. And the power to interview a child without their parents can be necessary, many children will not speak frankly in the presence of their parents. especially if for example the child is not happy being schooled at home and would rather go to school. And it is the good of the child which is important here, not the whims of the parents. &#10;Not all parents are good parents, and society has a responsibility to protect the rights of children. The only way to do this is to have OBJECTIVE standards, and to apply them equally to ALL.
