The school building was old but well maintained. The best I could get out of the neighbors was &quot;the school system is OK&quot;. I really didn't want OK but we are not Catholic and private schools were $10,000 a year elementary, $20,000 a year high school plus a 45 minute drive one way. I probably could have afforded it if I worked a few overtime shifts or got a second job and never went on vacation, but I wasn't sure if it was worth it. I debated myself into a tizzy, convinced that this decision would be the be all end all of my children's lives. I debated so long that there were no slots left in kindergarten and he had to be put on a waiting list. &#10;So My son went to the local public kindergarten and guess what- &quot;it was OK&quot; enough for me. I took him off the waiting list and decided I would supplement the public school education with the private school tuition money I saved. I went with the mindset that I never would trust the public school and I watched them like a hawk. I was very active in PTO, worked bingo etc. I worked pretty much full time and still did this- I use to call it my &quot;hobby&quot; because it was pretty much all I did besides work and home. I Enjoyed PTO- it was my social outlet too. &#10;Public school worked for us. My kids were above average but not genius so the public schools &quot;teaching to the average&quot; wasn't a problem. BUT they were not ambitious students. The only way I think private school would have benefited them was that since they tended to do JUST what they were told to do and no more, private school would have been better because it would have made them do more. &#10;I considered home schooling, but working full time makes that hard (although there are people I work with that do it) I don't think my boys would have been easy to homeschool. I could see fights on getting their school work done. &#10;I will never know if I made the right decision. But my children did fine. The one thing I learned that decisions like this do not make or break children's lives.
