The main thrust of the Gonski report was the plight of disadvantaged (ie poor) and disabled children who require extra assistance. Australian &quot;private&quot; schools leave these children at the door as a result of the interview process which is denied to state schools who are forced to take all children with the exception of those who have shown criminal behaviour. This would be marginally acceptable if the schools were truly private, as I believe is the case in the USA ie 100% privately funded, but given that 80% of their funding is government, they should be forced to take their share of these resource needy children and in numbers beyond the few &quot;let them have the crumbs&quot;scholarships that are handed out to appease public conscience. If this occurred Gonski funding required would be halved. The further problem with this selective filtering is the skewing of OP results as a result of lowering of the state schools average academic level which is used as a weighting (here in Qld) when considering each child's academic result. My daughter, although brilliant at her state school, could not get an OP 1 score in her final year unless she had some disability. This has implications for hard to get in courses in tertiary education. The flow on of this into society is a class structure where coming from the right school gives you an advantage over others in employment and life. As a result, Australians are more class conscious now than the English who, as you have pointed out, along with other countries, have strived to rid themselves of this stupidity in their societies. &#10;Peter M - that's simply not true. Private schools cannot discriminate against a student with a disability and cannot refuse enrolment. The only grounds they can deny enrolment is the same grounds that a public school can, and that is where the cost and disruption of the disability will impact to &quot;an unreasonable degree&quot; on the school's ability to provide educational services to the rest of the school population. And the 'unreasonable degree' test is quite a high bar. &#10;Poor people aren't discriminated against or disadvantaged by society in this country - they have free housing, free money, free health care, free education, and can take a loan from the government to go to university. It fact, the systems are there for them to be anything they want. The only thing they are disadvantaged by is their parents. &#10;Truthful - sorry, but you're not. Private schools have the absolute right to select their students and staff on whatever grounds they wish; they have an exemption from anti-discrimination laws. To their credit, not all utilise it, but many do. While public schools enrol about 65% of students overall, they have 78% of those with disabilities (Catholic, 16%, Independent 6%). Public schools also enrol 85% of Aboriginal students, 83% from remote areas and 79% of those from the bottom 1/4 of SES parents. Figures available from ABS (2011) DEEWR (2010) and ACARA (2011). &#10;Oh, and 'I hate pies' where is all this free housing (public housing is grossly insufficient, and it usually requires a co-payment) free money (Newstart? only if you jump through every hoop in the book to prove you cannot get a job, and it's really a princely sum) free health care (if you are willing to wait years for elective surgery) free education - yes, but not all of the ancillary resources - and HECS loans are not means-tested. Wakey, wakey. And certainly 'picking' the wrong parents is a disadvantage - so should we visit the sins/inadequacies of parents on these children forever? Not only is that inequitable, it also happens to be economically irrational, reducing productive human capital.
