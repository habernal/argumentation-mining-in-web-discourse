I have 12 years of private school education and 4 years college education.  My husband has 14 years of private school education (some college) and 2 college degrees.  He and I work together and run our own business. 2.  We have 4 children, ALL have attended private schools, the oldest 3 have 12 years of private school education each, with public 4 year college degrees, 2 of them are now back in college for their second and third degree.  The last is STILL IN private school and has another 2 years to go to complete his 12 years!!! 3.  If my family has the advantage of a better education because we choose that for our children it is OUR BUSINESS, not yours to judge the kind of people we are. 4.  In my household, WE all WORK! Which is something that the public school system is not used to producing.  My whole family are hard working, educated, independent adults, giving the last child the knowledge, education, opportunity to become the same.    5. We do not think we are better than anyone else because they may go to public school.  Last time I checked, only by the grace of God and the American military, we are still a FREE COUNTRY. I can CHOOSE to send my children to a PRIVATE school, it is up to you to decide what is right for your family!! 6.  Just for your information, we work for what we have, no one GAVE us anything.  We do not EXPECT the government to give a handout, like so many others.   7.  I do invest in the PUBLIC SCHOOL EDUCATION, while I PAY to send my children elsewhere for theirs.  Stop trying to tell families that send their children to private schools what to do, mind your business and don't worry.  Those of us that pay to send our children to private schools are taking care of the public school children (by force, I might add) by paying taxes.   8.  You choose to spend your money on whatever it is you spend it on and I choose to educate my children in a private school environment with like minded parents! Thank you and have a good day!
