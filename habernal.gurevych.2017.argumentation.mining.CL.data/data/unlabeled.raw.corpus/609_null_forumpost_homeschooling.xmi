I not saying your kids aren't social. I am saying the setting isn't as social as PS is. The home itself isn't as social as public school, because you have a very limited number of people at home. But the setting for homeschooling isn't simply at your home. You have just as much opportunity to be social outside of your home during school hours as a child enrolled in public school. But unlike public school, the exposure, the people, and the diversity can be different every day. The socialization a child receives in public school is a valid form of socialization, but it isn't the only form. It isn't the best method, the normal method, or the approved method of socialization. It is simply one valid choice among many. I prefer a different method of socialization for my children than one that is typically offered in public schools, but I do wish for my children to have the same number of opportunities to be social. And they do. I can understand why educators who are passionate about their profession sometimes take decisions to homeschool personally. To them you are in a way spitting on teachers when you decide to homeschool. That may not be your intent, and maybe it shouldn't feel that way to teachers, but I can see why it would. Honestly, I don't. I don't see why they would. It is not a personal affront to teachers when I make a decision about my children based on my values and priorities. Teachers are valuable and instrumental, just like daycare workers. But I'm not spitting on the people who have dedicated their lives to early childhood development and their love for children when I decide to stay at home with my kids. I don't doubt at all that most teachers have a vested interest in the welfare of children and the value of education. But they don't have a vested interest in my children, specifically. I'm not here to populate classrooms. I have a responsibility to my children and teachers have a responsibility to their students. Those two obligations don't cross over. I admire teachers who are passionate about their students. My children aren't their students. I have no interest in denigrating public school teachers. They are essential to our society. But on a personal level, public school teachers have no relationship with my children and vice versa. My children have relationships with other teachers, including myself, and will have relationships with professors in college. Our decision to homeschool says nothing about public school teachers. Nothing.
