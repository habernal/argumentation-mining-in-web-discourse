It describes pretty explicitly how small boys are damaged by the school environment - in particular, by having to sit still indoors at a desk doing delicate tasks like copying and colouring in. Because they're forced into an unnatural environment, their behaviour suffers, and they come into conflict with (mainly female) members of staff who simply don't understand what they are about or how to help them thrive and who respond to their totally natural dislike of the situation by yelling. They come out angry, frustrated, aggressive and misogynist. Many girls feel the same. &#10;In fact, normal classroom education is probably only really suited to a small minority of girls who thrive on sitting down quietly doing intricate tasks. &#10;Now, the state is never going to want to spend money creating a Steiner/Montessori-type school system which fits children instead of expecting children to fit to it. In any case, it wouldn't do so for ideological reasons - the whole reason we have kids dumped behind desks day in and day out is because it is thought to adapt them to the workplace (a mistaken idea if ever there was one). &#10;Many children benefit from an explorative approach to education. They like to be able to find things out, to have space alone to do things for themselves, to be up and about, to go to see things rather than having them written on a blackboard or in a textbook. If a parent can provide these things, why not? Kids can socialize at scouts, at youth clubs, on the streets when other kids come home from school in the evening, wherever. &#10;From the way some people are talking, you'd think that schools are well-run by staff who were all educated and trained to a very high level of expertise. They're not. Of course, there are many excellent teachers. But there are also many teachers who have barely scraped a 2/2 degree and know little about the subjects they teach. Even at GCSE and A level. Quite a lot are not even particularly good with children. &#10;The truth is that the school system is random and haphazard. It's not a well-designed tool for providing education and socialization - it's a Heath Robinson affair set up for maximum financial efficiency. It just about succeeds at keeping kids off the street. It educates them very poorly, and judging from the standard of behaviour in Britain in general, it socializes very poorly too.
