Given that we have so little reliable information about HE in the UK in terms of uptake, motivations, practices and outcomes we don’t know if we are comparing Granny Smith to Golden Delicious or Oranges to Cashews. &#10;In response to&#10;“I was expressing an opinion on my experience. Obviously this will be limited, just as yours is” &#10;You are incorrect to state that I too am basing my position on my personal experience alone.&#10;You said ““it seems that when a parent hands over the education of their child to a school they seem to feel that this is where their own obligations end.” &#10;The following suggests that you are mistaken.&#10;The sheer volume of features, articles and news reports pitched at parents with regards to ideas and issues in education and how they as parents can impact their child’s progress, outcome, attainment, confidence/emotional wellbeing as a learner outside the classroom. The mainstream media does not produce material for a niche market in such volume. &#10;The significant number of ad-funded websites aimed at parents that provide a dedicated education section. Often with well populated forums to permit the exchange of ideas, advice and support between parents who are engaged and concerned with their child’s experiences and attainment at school. The size of the “educational resources” industry and the extent to which they view parents as quarry. &#10;There will be and has always been a sub set of parents who have little or no interest in their children at all. Ditto those who do not regard education as particularly important. &#10;Given that “compulsory” school is the default setting it is hardly a huge surprise that these parents tend use mainstream education. &#10;That doesn’t mean they are representative of parents with kids at school.&#10;No more than they would have been representative of HEing parents if the LEAs had been allowed to carry on willy nilly, strong-arming them (among others) out of mainstream ed and into HE.
