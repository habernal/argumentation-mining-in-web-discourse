Armed with enough knowledge to be able to hold a proper conversation and also prove I know my rights, we've come to an agreement that she is going to chase our paedatrician for a copy of ADOS and other medical reports and I am going to have a chat with nursery SENCo next week (half term not over yet) to tell her that I genuinely don't think mainstream is going to work and I NEED to get the whole process shifting forward. &#10;I was told that we need to get it done now, as we have not had an action for inclusion meeting - who I spoke with today has agreed to arrange that with SENCo (She knows her well) and come to that meeting, SENCo will be there, Me and OH will and the outreach worker who is from the special school I am intending on him going to will also be invited. Everything will be covered. 12 months from here (though we can put in early if absolutely necessary) we will be able to request statuatory assessment, and according to lady today, DS will not struggle getting the appropriate support and we have all the correct professionals involved already thankfully! &#10;So hopefully now I know my rights and have had lots of support off you guys on here, I will be able to travel through the next 18 months knowing what to expect and a clear mind of the outcome... positive thinking! &#10;Thanks so much to you all!"/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1687" language="en" documentId="4966" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Jen W(34)" date="14-04-10 01:21" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://www.netmums.com/coffeehouse/netmums-coffeehouse-archives-528/primary-school-admission-appeals-clinic-599/404307-special-educational-needs-re-mainstream-school-all.html" topic="mainstreaming" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="4966" notes="" title="Special Educational Needs re.
