They had lots of friends (they still see them). &#10;When I deregistered my two boys, the HEAD teacher of the school told me she thought I was doing the right thing, and if her children were in the school system now, she would home educate them. She has been a teacher for 22 years and has seen the National Curriculum morph and grow into a stifling tick box nightmare for teachers. &#10;My children are a well known part of local society - they know the names of the librarian, the elderly on our street, the sports coaches at the athletics club, the shop keeper, the local policeman, the local farm, several museum curators and so much more. They are not hidden, they are very visable to all those around them. &#10;My children are registered, but are living proof that a registration system doesn't work. I deregistered both my boys from school at the same time, but only one set of paperwork made it through the hoops. I have had to phone the LEA many times and have even met with them to remind them of his existence and still now, 2 years in, his name is missing off our paperwork. How could further registration and monitoring make this better? I fail to see how an already overworked EWO could cope with yet more paperwork. It is the huge waste of public money that I object to! &#10;Home education is a personal choice, and one that parents should be allowed to take without prejudice or fear.
