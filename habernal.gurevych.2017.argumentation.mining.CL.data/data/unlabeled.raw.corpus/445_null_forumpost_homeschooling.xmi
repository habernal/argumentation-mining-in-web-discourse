I've talked to my mom, and rather than teaching me and the one or two other kids who were ahead, we had to do the same work as others, or she would sometimes give us advanced work that we had no idea how to do. &#10;After that, I went to a private school for &quot;smart&quot; kids.  Most of the kids were pretty smart, but a lot of them were really immature, didn't act their age, and the school was overly organized and limiting due to its size.  I made a few friends, but the grade was so small that it was really hard when I was older and didn't have any other kids to talk to.  Also, my best friend was Jewish, and there were a wide variety of kids from different ethnic groups and religions. &#10;In ninth grade, I attempted to go to public school.  The size of it was overwhelming.  I didn't know any of the kids.  I transferred back to the private school for the rest of the year.  However, the private school ended after ninth grade.  In tenth grade, I went back to the same high school.  I miss some things, but I love the high school.  I have the opportunity to do team sports and take more classes on different topics and meet lots more kids.  I used to be incredibly shy, and I'm less so now, so I don't believe I could have learned in a public school with tons of kids when I was younger. &#10;On the various controversial things about public schools: I've discussed drugs with some kids, but there is no pressure to do them.  Religion isn't really discussed at school.  I'm Catholic, so are many of my friends, but certainly some of them aren't.  I'm not made fun of or bullied for having gone to another school or being smart or weird.  The cursing and open discussion of certain topics disturbed me a bit at first, but I just don't really listen and I'm just friends with a lot of kids who talk about books and writing and sports rather than inappropriate stuff. &#10;I don't know much about homeschooling, and I'm not going to pretend that I do.  However, I think that it's fine in many situations if done properly.  I'm Catholic and I don't mind public school, but I think that the media makes public school seem a lot worse than it really is- it just depends a lot on who you choose to talk to.
