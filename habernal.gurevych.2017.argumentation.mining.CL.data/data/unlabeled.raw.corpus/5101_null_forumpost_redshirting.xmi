There won't be an issue of redshirting because he's a March 2011 birthday; he'll be quite ready for kindergarten in 2013 when he's turned 5. &#10;Now, academically he would be totally ready for K now. He is already reading at about the level that my 6yo ODD is reading; his writing isn't quite where hers is, but it's pretty close to where hers was when she started K 6 months ago. In a lot of academic areas he's probably ahead of where she was when she started kindergarten. &#10;He's also pretty physically mature and big for his age, and about the size of a lot of the boys who are in pre-K this year and will be starting kindergarten in the fall. &#10;And he is socially mature in a lot of ways and can carry on some pretty amazing conversations with adults. He gets along very well with peers as well. But he still is socially not ready for kindergarten in other ways. We are still working with him on controlling tantrums, which are his one big problem. Those would just not fly in kindergarten, and he definitely needs another year to grow into himself and work with us and his preschool teachers on emotional reactions and impulse control before he's ready for a kindergarten environment. &#10;We could &quot;apply&quot; to skip pre-K and get him into kindergarten this year, and he'd almost certainly get in. It's something we actually thought about because we wondered if he might be bored when he finally does get to K, academically speaking. But socially and emotionally speaking, he really does just need more seasoning and I think he'll fare far better if he has the chance to mature a little. &#10;Granted, we're talking about skipping a grade rather than redshirting with him, but I think the principle is the same: emotional readiness is just as important as academic readiness. In fact, I think it's more so. In my ODD's kindergarten class, there's a girl who is already reading chapter books at probably a 4th-grade level, and kids who are still struggling with the &quot;Bob&quot; books, and all levels in between. The classroom adapts to those differences in abilities quite well. But these kids of different reading and math and spelling abilities are all at more or less the same level in terms of classroom behavior. Some are a bit more mature than others, some are a bit wilder--they're kids and they're individuals. But there's a baseline level of emotional and social maturity that lets the teacher keep the classroom from being totally disrupted. &#10;So I think academic readiness is necessary, but not sufficient, if you're debating whether or not to send a kid with a September or October birthday to kindergarten in their 4-turning-5 year or wait one more year. Social readiness is a big factor, and should not be downplayed.
