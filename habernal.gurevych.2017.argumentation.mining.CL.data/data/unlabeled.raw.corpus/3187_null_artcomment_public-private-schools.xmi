I went to private, (catholic) school for 12 years.  I received a much better education than my friends that went to public school. In  my first year of college, I aced all of my pre-requisites, some within the first month, because it was a work at your own pace structured class. Others that went to public school were struggling and I was able to help them in class so they would pass as well. No, I am not a brainiac or super smart person, I actually struggled in high school. The classes in private school are smaller and the teachers are able to spend more time with students. The teacher / student ratio makes students visible so they're NOT lost in the crowd. The classes are a more structured environment as well. With that being said, most public schools won't get better because the parents will &quot;improve the system for everyone&quot;.  The system will only get better if the parents actually take the time to teach their kids at home before the kids are of age to go to school instead of relying on the school to teach the kids all of the basics such as the ABC's &amp; 123's.    Learning starts at home from the day your children are born, at least it should. If every parent took the time to teach at home first, the teachers would have more time to spend on teaching new things, not things the children should already know.  That would make the school systems better.    It's amazing how much a child can learn just by reading a book to them at bed time or after dinner, it takes all of about 5 minutes to read and it enables the kids to ask questions and learn.
