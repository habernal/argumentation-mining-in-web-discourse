I or my husband was always with them as we split the child care duties and worked opposite shifts. I tried my best to teach them what they would need to know to be ready for kindergarten. My oldest went in to school in good shape, he just got right in there and did great. My younger sons were not the same. They were both younger when they started kindergarten. My middle son took a while to get on track and was held back in the 2nd grade. My youngest was held back in the 1st grade. This issue in my opinion doesn't have much to do with whether they were still 4 when they entered kindergarten or 5. I think schools are quick to pass along a student that isn't quite doing well, before they are ready. Fundamentals are so important. If your child doesn't do well in kindergarten you have to have the guts to say my child isn't ready to move on. I think that was hard for me and for the kids but in the end was the best decision I made for them. They are now doing very well and I am so proud of them. Know your child and don't allow them to be passed through the system without getting a good education.
