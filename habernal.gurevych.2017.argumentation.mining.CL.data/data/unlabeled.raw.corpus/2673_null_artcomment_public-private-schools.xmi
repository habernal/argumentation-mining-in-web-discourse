I benefitted greatly from the experience. When our school shut down and my parents could not afford for me to attend privately, I attended the public school in my area. My records were lost from my school, so I was prejudged by my appearance and the facts that my folks considered working poor. Both my parents worked, Father was military and Mom was teaching Head Start. I was put in a tier 4 class with learning challenged students, because I have a Tallulah Bankhead voice.  It was hilarious, my first day in my first class of 4th grade I was given a math workbook. My instructor, told all of us students to complete the first page. I completed the page in 20 seconds and closed my book, sat up straight in my seat and remained quiet, just like I was taught when I attended private school. The instructor saw me sitting quietly and asked if I completed that task, I replied that I had completed that assignment. She told me to complete the next page again another 20 seconds. Then she told me to complete as much as possible. I completed the entire workbook in 15 minutes. I took the completed book to her and she checked all pages and gave me the strangest look. Then, she asked another instructor to watch her class as she went to the Principal's office with my workbook clasped in her hand. Upon her return, she told me to report to the Principal's office. I was very afraid, because in my former school the Principal's office is were students that were in trouble would go, and I knew my Mom would be very upset if I were in trouble. I reported to the Principal's office with glassy eyes, almost on the verge of tears because I thought I had done something wrong. Mrs. Wilson came outside her office and motioned me to enter. I immediately asked her if I was in trouble, she told me no, but she wanted to know where my student jacket was from my former school. I explained the school closed and my Mom did not have that information. She told me that the workbook I completed would take the students in the classroom I came from the whole semester to complete. I told her that I learned that material in kindergarten. She ordered me to be tested to see what education level I was on and they found out I was an honor student. She sent a note home to my Mom requesting a meeting. Most of the kids that attended private school with me have advanced degrees. Some were dumb-ed down by Public school. Because public school is where children go to be trained, while private school is where leaders are made. It is where networking alliances are forged. Now for all the parents that are going to  feel offended, just look at our society. You get what you pay for, if you have a high tax base the schools will have better teachers and books and if not, that school will struggle. Of course you will find some good teachers in that environment, but a lot of parents will not be involved. They have to work just for the basics and a lot of hours. Add to that to the equation of, that the parents might not be well educated and you have substandard education. The real question this article should be asking, is it fair? Is it fair that you have to pay for your children's education to help ensure a better outcome in life? We could turn the education system around, but that would take some more progressive thinking and planning. But we can't have that because, who would serve the wealthy? Just my two cents, have a Blessed day!
