I have read your post and the replies and hope that the information I give you will help you to to get a school place for your daughter. I can't tell from your post how old your daughter is but I'm assuming that she is of compulsory school age? Let me know if not as it would affect the advice I'm giving you. &#10;First to clear up some confusion in the replies - applying for a school place for a child with SEN but no statement is a different process to applying for a school place with a statement. It is dealt with by separate depts in your local authority (LA). As your daughter does not have a statement and you need a school place you should be dealing with the Admissions Dept. &#10;If your daughter is of compulsory school age your LA has a duty to provide her with a school place. It does not have to be at the school of your choice (you can only express a preference) but theyprovide her with full time education. &#10;A school that is full can refuse to admit a child and the parent must be told of their right to make an appeal. A school that has vacancies can only refuse to admit a child in very limited circumstances. &#10;(guidance on the law covering SEN) is clear that schools must not refuse a place on the basis of SEN. The following is from paragaraph 1.33: &#10;&quot;A school may not refuse to admit a child because they feel unable to cater for their special educational needs. Pupils with special educational needs but without statements &#10;must be treated as fairly as all other applicants for admission. Admission authorities must&#10;consider applications from parents of children who have special educational needs but no&#10;statement on the basis of the school&#146;s published admissions criteria. Such children should&#10;be considered as part of the normal admissions procedures. Admission authorities cannot&#10;refuse to admit children on the grounds that they do not have a statement of special&#10;educational needs or are currently being assessed.&quot;&#10;The information above points you to what the law says about admissions and SEN and what the LA must provide for your daughter. If they are not meeting their legal duties you can take this further and start by making a formal complaint to the LA. In terms of what to do now I suggest the following: &#10;Make a formal request to your LA to carry out a statutory assessment. You can download a free booklet from the ACE website calledIf they refuse you can appeal to SEND Tribunal. &#10;You mention 17 schools - were these special schools or mainstream schools? You can not normally attend a special school without a statement. &#10;I can't tell from your post if you made a formal application for school places and were formally refused or if you just contacted schools to ask if they could take your daughter and were told no. You need to make a formal application for the schools you prefer - if you are then refused a place it will be formally in writing and if the schools are not following the Admissions Code or The SEN Code of Practice you can start to take this further by contacting the Director of Children's Services in your LA. As I've said, the LA must provide your daughter with education - telling you to keep her at home is not acceptable &#10;Ask Admissions if you can apply for a place on the basis of exceptional medical/social need - this criteria would allow you to explain why your daughter's needs mean that she should have priority. Ask what evidence you would need. &#10;If you are refused a place you have the right to make an appeal. See the ACE website for ourbooklet &#10;As someone previously suggested contact your local Parent Partnership Service (ask LA for their number) and also ask Admissions if there is a Choice Adviser in your area. They give support to parents applying and appealing for school places. &#10;You can also ring the free ACE adviceline on 0808 800 5793 to discuss your situation with one of our advisers. &#10;Good luck with this&#10;Sam"/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="3982" language="en" documentId="4903" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="ACE" date="02-12-11 16:39" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://www.netmums.com/coffeehouse/advice-support-40/special-needs-disabilities-support-502/683875-can-mainstream-school-refuse-admit-child-sen-all.html" topic="mainstreaming" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="4903" notes="" title="Can a mainstream school refuse to admit a child with sen?"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="400"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="401" end="773"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="774" end="1008"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="1009" end="1213"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="1214" end="1355"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="1356" end="1530"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="63" sofa="1" begin="1531" end="1622"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="1623" end="1711"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="71" sofa="1" begin="1712" end="1802"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="75" sofa="1" begin="1803" end="1890"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="79" sofa="1" begin="1891" end="1975"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="83" sofa="1" begin="1976" end="2027"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="87" sofa="1" begin="2028" end="2326"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="91" sofa="1" begin="2327" end="2504"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="95" sofa="1" begin="2505" end="2646"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="99" sofa="1" begin="2647" end="3270"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="103" sofa="1" begin="3271" end="3502"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="107" sofa="1" begin="3503" end="3603"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="111" sofa="1" begin="3604" end="3846"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="115" sofa="1" begin="3847" end="3958"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="119" sofa="1" begin="3959" end="3978"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="123" sofa="1" begin="3979" end="3982"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59 63 67 71 75 79 83 87 91 95 99 103 107 111 115 119 123"/></xmi:XMI>
