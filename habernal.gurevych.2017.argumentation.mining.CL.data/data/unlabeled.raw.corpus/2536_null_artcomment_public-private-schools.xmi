I send him to private school because I can afford it, and I refuse to spend my energy &quot;advocating&quot; in some crappy public school to make it better.  I think all parents have the responsibility to provide the best opportunities for their children.  If they aren't prepared to do do, and don't have the means, then don't. have. children.  SIMPLE. Somebody gotta preach dat s***.  Word.  Hey, wow!  Now I'm talking like a &quot;bad&quot; person!  Private schools have a right to exist just as much as public schools.  Think of it this way...if you grow up in a poor, violent, backward, ignorant, pathetic environment (like I did), and got the chance to move away from there, to a place where there are others like you, that aspire to be peaceful, and intelligent, and successful, and share those common traits with you, wouldn't you go?  I sure as Hades did, and I would do it again.  I send my kid to private school to get him away from the trash I had to deal with, and give him a better opportunity to come back and do some good for the community.  I depend on him to want to do that someday (if he wants to), because I won't.  My hatred for what I was exposed to is so deep, it's better for me to stay away, or I will do more damage than good.  If my kiddo wants to go and teach a bunch of poor souls in the inner city, that's his thing.  At least for now, I know he isn't suffering at the hands of a crappy, inferior school system, full of (for the most part) poor, angry, narrow minded, ignorant, incompetent, waste of lifes...(and that's just the school boards to start).  I think the author of that article is full of bleeding-hart-living-in-la-la-land crap.
