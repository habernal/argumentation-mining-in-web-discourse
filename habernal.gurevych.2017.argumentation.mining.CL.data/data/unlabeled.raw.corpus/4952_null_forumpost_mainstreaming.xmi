It really is just so frustrating isn't it! I think I'm going to try and give the pre-school a better picture of DS. As I say, it's almost always free choice so he doesn't have to &quot;conform&quot; just yet. When he does have to, and when he starts in any school he'll need to be used to it. &#10;I'm still stuck at do I apply and go straight for mainstream hopefully it'll work out, but perhaps it will not, or do I really push and try to get the special school place without even giving mainstream a proper chance first? &#10;Yeah, I will up his time at pre-school a few weeks after we get back off Easter break and ask about the IEP etc. Then after another couple of months I'll start asking again (if they haven't already) and push for the process a little more. While I'd love him to get on and not even need a 1-1, I know that this isn't going to happen, and even if DS doesn't need extra provisions until primary and he stays mainstream, there's no harm in him being much further along (i.e. halfway into school action plus) rather than where he is now... ? &#10;Are you coping ok with that then? Not too much pressure having to deal with another diagnosis on top of the problems your little boy already has? I know the boundaries and criteria are so, so flexible and far apart from one another with ASD and a few other conditions, so it's easy for it all to just become jumbled up. DS has ASD but apparently also has a speech and language disorder too (ongoing assessments for this though) but I'm not sure how they can say it as while I don't dispute the ASD for a minute, if he were given a S&amp;L Disorder DX too then it sort of seems like the ASD one would be negligent in a way as communication &amp; social (and behaviour) are his biggest issues - notmany problems with imagination, flexibility of thought or understanding of language. But ASD &amp; Speech and language disorders are so close together as it is! So how far along the spectrum he is, is a complete mystery until we know whether there is another reason behind his (non-existant) speech than the ASD... ??? CONFUSING IT ALL IS!
