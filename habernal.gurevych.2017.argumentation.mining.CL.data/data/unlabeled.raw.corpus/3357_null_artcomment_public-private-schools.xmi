My kids are my life, I'll give them the best education I can. My kids attend a charter school, but I still pay my taxes to the public school system. The charter school I send my kids to is ranked 37th out of close to 600 elementary schools rated in our state. The public school that I pulled my kids out of was ranked 539th... What would you do? My daughter attended Kindergarten and 1st grade in public school and she just floated along with the rest of the class and stayed average and was very bored. Last year she started 2nd grade at her charter school and she has excelled! She went up to an almost 4th grade level math, SIXTH grade level in Language Arts, and 5th grade level Reading. You really think because of this idiot's opinion that I'm a bad person because I send my child to a charter/private school is going to get me to put my kids back in the public education system??? Give me a break! (and by the way, the charter school is FREE, but listed as a private school, it just takes a lot of effort to get your kid enrolled and then 40 hours of volunteer time every year). It's the parents that treat the public schools like a glorified babysitter, and that don't help their kids with their schoolwork and don't get involved  and the government that are ruining the public school system.
