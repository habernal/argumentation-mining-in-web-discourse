Sorry if I misinterpreted. &#10;Considering the very real dangers of bullying (including the danger of suicide) I cannot see how bullying can be a 'wrong' reason for withdrawing a child from school. &#10;In my daughter's case she withdrew herself - she very understandably refused to go and I, being a teacher, took the relevant steps to see that her problem was dealt with before the EWO's got heavy. &#10;She was as a result treated by an excellent young adolescent unit and was able to return to school in the fifth year. But her education had been completely destroyed. &#10;Unfortunately even quite late in career I encountered colleagues who believed that bullying was 'part of life' and 'toughened kids up'. Despite all the anti bullying policies its still not taken seriously enough by many schools. &#10;Additionally not all children thrive in school, the regime is too rigid to take enough account of different learning styles. This is largely the result of class sizes which really do need to be smaller. &#10;Private schooling does have smaller classes and ironically most of the kids attending them can cope in bigger classes as on average they will tend to be brighter and are more likely to have parents who encourage their children's progress. &#10;The smaller the class the easier it is for the teacher to respond to individual learning needs. Pastoral issues like bullying are more likely to surface and be dealt with in those circumstances as well. Of course, unless the parent is a bully the issue all but disappears with home schooling. &#10;Of course, in any school, an ethos that discourages bullying is very important and it used to be the case that private schools had a poor record on this. I don't know if this is still true as I have no teaching experience in the private sector.
