Our local public school district gets very high rankings and is considered one of the best in the area.  However, we pulled our son out of public kindergarten last fall after seeing his usual inquisitive and enthusiastic personality falter.  He was acting out in class and was defiant at home, behavior that was very different from before school started.  After talking with his teacher, it was clear the material he was learning was too easy for him and not keeping his interest. When we asked about additional enrichment or having him attend reading with the first grade, it was out of the question.  His teacher had 30 kids in a class with no extra help.  Dealing with administration was not easy; we had to jump through hoops even for small requests.  My son's new kindergarten class had 14 students and an experienced teacher that spent time one on one with each child daily.  The difference was night and day!   The main thing I love about our school is kids are not taught to regurgitate material out of a textbook to pass standardized tests.  They're taught to think for themselves, solve problems and be independent.  Parents are directly involved with curriculum development and have daily interaction with teachers and administrators. Yes, it costs my family a lot of money to send our kids here, but we feel their education is one of the most important gifts we can give to them.  My children should not have to be an experiment in how to get things right in the public school system. They don't have an option of  a &quot;do-over&quot; if things don't work out.  Obviously, not all parents have the choice to send their kids to private school, but this was our choice to make, and we're glad we did.
