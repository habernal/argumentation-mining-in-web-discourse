It was a GREAT school. I was very satisfied w/ the curriculum, the ethics and morals that was part of their daily routine, LOVED the teachers, etc. There was not one bad thing that I could think of in terms of this particular private school. But when we made the decision to put him into public school, and I was biased because this particular public school was where I attended my whole life, I really could not tell a difference in anything. He still had to be pushed when it came to homework. He was just as challenged in public school as he was in private. By the time he was in JHS, he and his friends were at that &quot;fork in the road&quot;. Some of his friends were heading down the wrong path and that concerned me. Then Katrina came through and forced us to move to a different location so he was in the next school district over. I wasn't keen on changing him to this school but in the end it worked out for the better. That path that ODS was on the fence about heading down w/ his friends, was turned. I still didn't see much difference academically in changing to these two public schools than I did when he was in private school...as far as him needing to be challenged anyway. The only difference was in the socialization department...but that very easily could have been a byproduct of any school that he would have attended.
