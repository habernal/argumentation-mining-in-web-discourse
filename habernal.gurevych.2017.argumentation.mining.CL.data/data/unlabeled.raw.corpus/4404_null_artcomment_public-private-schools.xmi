At public schools if you're unhappy with the teacher or the systems or the way your child is being treated, you are virtually powerless to do anything about it because your not paying for it- technically (let's ignore taxes). But for $300000 a year your complaints do get answered and looked into, a right many people are happy to pay for when it comes to their children. If you think of all the crap you spend money on every year, it would easily add up to $30000, I'd rather not spend on the crap, but make sure I have control over what happens at the place where my kids spend more than half their lives. &#10;The 'crap' I spend my $30,000 on is rent, food, bills, clothes etc. And there ain't much of my income left over. A lot of people don't have a spare $30,000 lying around. Aren't you the lucky one? &#10;I am sorry that Margi's experience at public schools has been that her concerns are not responded to (although it is not entirely clear from her e-mail that her children have ever attended a public school). My experience at the local public school which my children attend is that concerns are always listened to and dealt with to the extent possible within the resources of the school. Whether those resources are adequate is of course another question and is not going to be helped by a continuation of a trend that sees more children attending private schools. &#10;I would also question whether the &quot;main reason&quot; that many parents send their children to private schools is the &quot;right of reply&quot;. Many of the parents I speak to who send their children to private schools talk a lot about &quot;discipline&quot; and then seem to be particularly impressed by the fact that they (the parents) are sent reminders about when their children's homework is due. This may be handy in the short term but is hardly a great way to teach self-discipline. &#10;Note that I attended non-selective public schools throughout my life and enjoyed my schooling. I also did sufficiently well academically to study law at Sydney University. On the other hand, my husband attended a GPS school and looks back on those years with something approaching horror. He was not encouraged to pursue his passion (music) and repeated his HSC at the local TAFE (where he performed significantly better). Clearly, these are merely anecdotes, but they are far from consistent with a generalisation that private schools give you a &quot;right of reply.&quot; "/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2512" language="en" documentId="4404" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Margi" date="September 04, 2013, 6:48AM" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://www.theage.com.au/comment/private-schools-and-the-art-of-ripping-off-parents-20130903-2t357.html" topic="public-private-schools" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="4404" notes="" title="Private schools and the art of ripping off parents"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="718"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="719" end="915"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="916" end="1480"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="1481" end="1946"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="1947" end="2512"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55"/></xmi:XMI>
