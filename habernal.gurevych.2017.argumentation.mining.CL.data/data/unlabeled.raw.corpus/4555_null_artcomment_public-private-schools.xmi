All the snide &quot;barbs&quot; and &quot;slurs&quot; carefully presented as informed &quot;opinion&quot; in the &quot;quotation marks&quot; in your article make you appear as just another biased academic ideologue. &#10;Here's why I send my kid to private school - they are taught to have self respect, to be respectful of others, to take responsibility for their actions and omissions, to care for the environment, to think laterally, to ask questions, and how to go about analysing a proposition and the processes of thinking and reflection. &#10;The teachers are required to provide a high degree of care, and leave no-one behind - that is the &quot;extra&quot; that you pay for - the quality of the teachers, and their focus on and knowledge of the individual kids. &#10;The social and cultural diversity in the school community is extremely broad, and the school community is inclusive and welcoming of all, no matter their economic, social or cultural background. I pay taxes to maintain the education system, and I choose to pay more to buy a little extra attention for my kid. &#10;The school has a 'twin' school in a third world country, for whom they run an annual fund raiser with the money raised spent on books and supplies to be sent the the twin school. &#10;Yes it costs a lot of money which we could otherwise use to pay the mortgage or go on holiday, but at least my kid is not being bullied, threatened or assaulted by psychopathic uncontrollable kids, is not being indoctrinated into the lazy socialist sense of entitlement or biased views of the protected species otherwise known as the teachers union. &#10;And I am the child of a state school principal, and sibling of 2 state school teachers.&#10;All those things my local public school does - except they also accept any and all children from within their intake area regardless of their academic ability or the depth of their pockets. &#10;My kids are respectful and respected. Their teachers love their jobs and chamipon for them at every opportunity. &#10;They have environmental projects sponsored by Landcare, have fabulous pastoral care from the school Chaplain and access to an abundance of complimentary activities such as choir, extended science projects, academic extension, dance and even have camps to Canberra to ensure the older children have a grasp on our national identity. And I'm not paying for a new BMW for the local pastor. &#10;What planet are you on? Talk about defensive. Do you really think private school teachers are 'better'? I've taught in both systems and I'd say they're equivalent. Arguments like yours are the reason we need to get rid of private schools. You can't think clearly and just justify your own position with no real evidence. No wonder our society is becoming more elitist. Your children will probably end up as narrow minded and molly coddled as you are.
