It really does depend on the child. Yes, we are talking about your child and you do have the final say-so, of course. I am so tired of hearing the &quot;bored&quot; word. Your child by and large is NOT bored. They may not enjoy what they're learning, but they are not bored. But they see the &quot;reaction&quot; they get from their parents when they say that word. We teachers are trained to provide individualized instruction, differentiated instruction, and response to intervention for the struggling ones, among other tactics. Students are never all on the same level. Retention is a hot issue, but I believe in it in certain cases. I think if it happens, it needs to be before 3rd grade. Lots of things need to be taken into consideration. I had a child who came back to see me in high school and thanked me for holding her back. She said it was the best thing that ever happened to her. I have also had another child say the same thing to a team of evaluators during a school evaluation 3 years ago. In the past 16 years that I have been at this school, I have held back about 4 students. I didn't regret any of them. No, they don't all level out by 3rd grade either. I've seen kids passed on by their parents against my better judgement. Self esteem? Wait til they get in middle grades and check out self esteem when they're not able to deliver, but parents' feelings were too hurt to take the tough approach at the time it was needed. Now we're talking big self esteem issues.
