Some are for scheduled prayer time, some think it should be voluntary, some think it should be private - but allowed. Some think it should be banned completely. There are miriad sides to this issue as with any other. &#10;But I have a more specific issue. When I was a freshman in high school, I had a very Christian friend. She was nice about it - she knew I was a theist, didn't try to force her religion on me, she'd always pray silently when I was around. She only teased me about being a religious malcontent when I teased her about worshipping a 2,000 year old Zombie (No offense, to you Christians out there) Very polite, if you ask me. And she also brought her Bible to school, just to read between classes. &#10;One day a teacher saw it, took it and her down to the principles office. She was almost expelled for reading, in my opinion, a book of fiction. The same type of books we're required to reading in Creative literature and in some cases philosophy. She was almost expelled, in her opinion, for reading a book of fact. The same thing we're required to do to pass any of our classes. In the end, she was suspended - for reading a book. &#10;Is the supression of religion itself an act by the government of establishment of religion?&#10;By disallowing expression of religion in schools, be it Christian or not, are we effectively instituting an...I dont' know -theistic regime? &#10;Are we as a society and a government sticking our noses where they don't belong - into the lives of students?
