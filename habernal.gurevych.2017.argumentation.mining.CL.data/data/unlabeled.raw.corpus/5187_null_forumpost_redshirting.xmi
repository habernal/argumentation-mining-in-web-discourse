(or close to it) we had to have him evaluated for the state grant funded pre k this year, they go strictly by birthday, if you are to old they refer you to kindy. so he will go to pre k next year, then to K.. and i am thinking we may hold him back in K. besides being hte youngest, he is pretty small, and has speech issues. I don't know socially how he will do, he doesn't go anywhere i am a sahm. (my original plan was a less formal preschool next year, 2 days a week forlike a hour or so, then the year after pre k, then K.. but that isn't going to happen.)
