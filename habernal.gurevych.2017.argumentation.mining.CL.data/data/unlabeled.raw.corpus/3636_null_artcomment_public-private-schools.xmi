I sent my kid to private school. And would again too. The reasons are many. Not the least of which is he didn't have to deal with kids who didn't want to be in school, he didn't have to deal with lousy teachers who didn't care, he didn't have to deal with teachers who owed more allegiance to the union than to the students and the school. I theory, her idea of changing the local public schools is great. In practice, it doesn't work. The various teacher's unions have long ago contributed to the destruction of the public school system. As have the politicians who dole out the money for the schools. And it is not going to change. Today's public schools have more money than schools in the 50's or 60's did, and the students they turn out are for the most part dumber. The ability to read, write or even do basic math is worse today than it was in days gone by. They don't teach hardly any history, and what they do &quot;teach&quot; is no longer what is the truth, it's a sanitized version. And there is damn little of it as well.   I may be a &quot;bad&quot; person for sending my kid to private school...but she's an idiot for thinking that anyone who wants to help their kid get ahead is a bad person. In fact, I'd say she and her sort are one of the reasons that non-rich people (which most who send their kids to private school are) scrimp and save to do so. To enable their kids to be smarter than she is!
