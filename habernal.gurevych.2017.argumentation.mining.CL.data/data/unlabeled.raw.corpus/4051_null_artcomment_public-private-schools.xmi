Each child develops differently, learns at their own pace you can not compare one child's learning to another. Teachers do the very best they can to teach your child in public and private schools I have worked in both and I can honestly say this is true. However true learning starts with the parents at home parents need to take an interest in their child's learning and reinforce the lessons being taught in school. There needs to be good parental involvement and good communication between parent and teacher you need to work as a team to give your child the very best education you can. It is not just up to the teacher ii is up to the parent as well your child will learn no matter what school they go to they will perform to the best of their individual ability and get a good education. Some children learn faster than others and need to work on different skills in the classroom but each and every child in school has the potential to learn and succeed . parents need to stop pointing fingers at teachers if your child is struggling it is not the teachers fault parents need to spend more time helping their children and take more of an active role in their learning that is the key to a good education. Bottom line learning starts at home from the parents.
