If this isn't the Bible, then I don't know what is. &#10;As a teacher of the public school system, payed for by ALL tax dollars, your personal feelings are suppose to be left at the door. No one is saying you can't pray between classes (in private and NOT to children), and I doubt (I'm not sure) there is anything wrong with having your old book on the desk during class as long as you don't read to the class from it. Your personal rights ARE affected when you become a public servant. Be being a public servant, you acknowledge that you will serve EVERYONE of any or no faith,. To do this, would mean you HAVE to leave your personal views on religion out of your job as a teacher, unless you are fully prepared to teach all other religions at the same time and I highly doubt you could do this. Be honest, you wouldn't want a Muslim teacher teaching YOUR children THEIRabout the Quran. Muslims are required to pray 5 times a day, would you want your children to stop learning for 10 mins each time while this teacher faced in the direction of Mecca, got out his carpet, and put his head on the ground to pray, yelling Allahu Akbar? Of course not. &#10;You might be better off teaching in a parochial school with your own kind. But as a public servant, you don't have religious rights (as you know them) during working hours on the public dime, just like a Jewish teacher or a Muslim teacher in the public system. So you see it all works out in the end.
