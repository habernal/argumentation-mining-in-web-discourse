For the most part, if you have a good school, or a good curriculum neither is really better than the other, but some kids work better in one situation over the other. For instance, my brother hated every second of homeschooling. He did well as far as grades went, just like he did in public school but the lack of friends was killing him. Now we have moved back to where we were living originally and he is back in public school and is surrounded by a group of friends and still has good grades. I am an introvert and staying up in my bedroom while I take classes online is one of the best things that could happen to me, school wise. I've never been an extrovert, and I've never really had tons of friends, but that really has nothing to do with home school, since I had many chances to make friends at co-op and church, but I just don't do things like that. I am just more comfortable this way, plus I ride horses and this way I can ride any time during the day for as long as I can. &#10;When it comes to home school there are two major stereotypes I have noticed, and both are true, to some extent. The first is the slightly awkward genius. I don't fit into this category (at least the genius part) but I have seen many of my home school friends who do, though some lean more to one side than the other. The other is the really awkward, immature idiot. I can't say I've seen any of these that are over 13, but you could say that as a home schooler myself, I'm in no place to judge. I suppose some parents shelter their kids waaaay more than others and that is so not a good idea in my opinion, but I've never really thought of my parents, or the parents of my fellow friends who are home schooled, as extremely conservative, though that might be due to the area we lived in, I can't really say. &#10;I am being taught through a Christian curriculum, but when it comes to evolution I have learned quite a bit about it too, and I have made my own decisions about my beliefs. Not every Christian home schooler is a creationist. I have friends who completely disagree with my family. &#10;For the most part, if it is done correctly, I think neither is truly better than the other, but it just depends on your personality and situation.
