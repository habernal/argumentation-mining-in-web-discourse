Fairness is the harm. And I don't believe that a parent wouldn't lie for their kid. Sure, they shouldn't, but the fact of the matter is that at bestyou're pretending that an independent assessment is the same thing as an assessment conducted by an associated party, and in any other context that's not acceptable -- it shouldn't be acceptable here. I am somewhat ok with that, if there's room and the team's not competitive, but when we're talking about a finite number f spots being determined by, among other things, attendance and academic performance in a school context, that's not fair to the students who are actually meeting those standards in the context of school. &#10;2. As noted, in many districts the district gets no funding for students who do not attend, or who attend other schools (charters, cyber academies, etc.). In some districts they even pay for students to attend other schools (in my district, this is true of kids in state-sanctioned homeschool/cyberschool hybrids and in thereapeutic schooling arrangements). But if a homeschool kid participates in public school activities, they incur costs associated with those activities. Therefore siphoning funding from the actual students of the public school. And yes, you pay taxes -- but so do people like myself, with no kids in the school system, and many people who have no benefit from the school system other than an educated citizenry. If the district isn't being paid for your child to actually be a student within it, your children are not part of the school.
