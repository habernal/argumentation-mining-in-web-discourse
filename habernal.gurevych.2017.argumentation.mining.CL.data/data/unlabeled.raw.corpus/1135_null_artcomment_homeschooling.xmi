In the current economic climate we cannot do both. In the boom and borrowing years it did not seem like we could train and fund these services adequately and it would be positively criminal to let the agencies involved spin a lie about the causes of these tragedies that actually made a recurrence more likely by squandering much needed funds. &#10;Here is another excellent blog post by a home educator who felt compelled to investigate whether home education could have been a real issue in the death of this poor girl, it goes through events in careful detail to try and find where things went wrong, &#10;http://www.uncharted-worlds.org/blog/2010/07/systems-people-and-the-death-of-khyra-ishaq/&#10;It really is important to understand this in order to take effective action, if you don't know where you really are you can never find the right direction! &#10;Unfortunately the Heads of Children's services and some of the people who fear the consequences of making a mistake in this area are looking for a scapegoat and as we can see many people are more than happy to discredit and speculate on things they have no experience of. &#10;I have four children ranging from 32 to 12, they are all bright but have learning differences, they have all been to school. From my extensive reading, my experience of living with them and myself I would say that the very best school situation could well be harmful to such children as they are totally the wrong shape for the system and learn from a very young age that they are defective. They are of course not defective but different and very inconvenient for the school system. &#10;My youngest begged at the age of 8 to be home educated after hearing a mention of it in a news item on TV. She had undeniable arguments to support her request and although it was not on my plan for the future there was no way I could in conscience refuse. I am now so grateful as it has led us into a supportive, imaginative, creative, resourceful and supportive community that has enabled her to grow in a natural and organic way at her own pace. The rest of the family have also benefited enormously . &#10;We too attended the Home Ed summer camp and the totally voluntary Children's cabaret is something I have never experienced the like of in my 57 years. The stumbling beginnings of an effort receive the same level of support and enthusiasm as the truly spectacular mastery of music dance and other arts that home education enables by giving a child time to follow their passions and the absence of judgement and criticism. The undamaged pleasure in sharing their interests and joy of performing shines out of these children's eyes and is a rare and precious gift to them from their parents and the home educating community. &#10;Do not worry about home educated children, on the whole they share time and decision making with their parents, they are powerful in their own lives and happy and learning.
