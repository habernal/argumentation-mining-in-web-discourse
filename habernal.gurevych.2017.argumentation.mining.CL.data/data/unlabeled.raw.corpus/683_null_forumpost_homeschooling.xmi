Deciding to homeschool my daughter was a 3-year process, and it was often painful, given how committed I have always been to public education, and given that my DH is a public school teacher. I have had to struggle internally with the conflict between my beliefs about what is best for my child vs what I believe about public education as a whole. In the meantime, I've continued to vote for levies, policy makers who I believe will support education, etc. I've continued to support public school fundraisers at our local schools to the extent that I can, financially. But when it came down to it, I could not put my daughter in a setting that I ultimately felt would be harmful to her as a learner. &#10;It's an unfair question, obviously, but so was the &quot;why don't you advocates for public schools work for better funding instead of concentrating on homeschoolers?&quot; question. Both have a bunch of false assumptions in them. &#10;I don't believe I asked that question of you personally, though if I did I stand corrected. I think I simply pointed out that if there is a problem, the people to take it up with are those in charge of funding, rather than just with those who use the system. &#10;Though if you are personally benefiting from an inequitable system, and you aren't doing anything to change that, I absolutely consider that immoral. &#10;I agree. I think that every one of us is charged with the duty to do what we can to reform inequitable systems, in all aspects of life.
