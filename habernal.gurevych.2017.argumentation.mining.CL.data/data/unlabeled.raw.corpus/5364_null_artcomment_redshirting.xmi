I have a 6yr old 1st grader, who is an Oct born and went to school early because of a Jan cutoff in CT.She loves school and I can see that it was a right decision because she would have clearly been bored if I let her stay in preschool. She is keeping up very well and does not seem pressured at the same time sufficiently challenged. But like others have said it depends on the child. I come from India where no matter what, kids are sent off to Lower Kindergarten at age 4. Again the kids who can cope do well but those who have issues continue to have problems throughout. It definitely hurts their confidence and before we know it they have a very hard time keeping up. Personally I think its a parents choice, you know your child best. &#10;But in my opinion the education system here in the US is not as tough as in India. Though it seems like the kids are really pressured, I think its better to learn to study hard from a young age than being unable to cope later and drop out. Better to learn as much when we are younger and specialize in subjects we love later. My Bacherlor's degree concentrated on the 3 subjects I wanted to do most rather than all the topics under the sun. I did learn all the subjects rigorously until 10th grade. As much as I love elementary education in the US ,it feels like as we go into higher education the system used in India/UK are more efficient and cost effective. I am digressing here so I will stop talking "/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1476" language="en" documentId="5364" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Bettycrocker" date="November 14, 2012 at 2:19 pm" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://schoolsofthought.blogs.cnn.com/2012/11/12/my-view-kindergarten-redshirting-different-for-each-child/comment-page-2" topic="redshirting" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="5364" notes="" title="My View: Kindergarten redshirting different for each child"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="770"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="771" end="1476"/><types:PersuasivenessAnnotationMetaData xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" annotator="annotator1" isPersuasive="true" labelDetailed="P1" isGold="false" annotationBatchName="firstTraining" conflictResolvingAnnotation="false"/><types:PersuasivenessAnnotationMetaData xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" annotator="annotator2" isPersuasive="true" labelDetailed="P1" isGold="false" comment="In the first paragraph her stance is quite clear, however, in the second paragraph she gets a bit neutral." annotationBatchName="firstTraining" conflictResolvingAnnotation="false"/><types:PersuasivenessAnnotationMetaData xmi:id="71" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" annotator="annotator3" isPersuasive="true" labelDetailed="P1" isGold="false" comment="against redshirting (she sent her daughter sooner), but quite hard... the second paragraph is off-topic" annotationBatchName="firstTraining" conflictResolvingAnnotation="false"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 59 71"/></xmi:XMI>
