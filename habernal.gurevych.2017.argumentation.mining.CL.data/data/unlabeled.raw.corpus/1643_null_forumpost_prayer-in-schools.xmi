My husband and I are both educators--we do not bring our own personal faith into the classroom as this would violate the beliefs and rights of the students. However, I do not believe that children should be exempt from openly expressing themselves in school, be it through prayer or their undying support for evolution . And furthermore, your mockery of that which is a highly time honored and respected tradition in many households, is offensive, to say the very least. I was raised in an agnostic and atheist household. I found Christianity later in life, on my own, after much research and many faith building processes. I have wonderful parents and was not raised in a dysfunctional home. I do not believe that any religious practice should be pushed on children in public schools--but I don't believe religious children should be pushed out of public schools, either. All children, whether they are: Pagan, Native American, Buddhist, Jewish, Atheist, or &quot;Flying Spaghetti Monster Worshipers&quot;, etc., should be given the freedoms to express themselves. Not silently--but openly, if they wish. Distracting, some call this...I call bull! It is also distracting, to some, when a student comes dressed in all black with their hair painted purple, too. But, that is what makes this country great--we are exposed to all beliefs and expressions and allowed to express ourselves freely. Let's teach our children to be tolerant and understanding, not to be followers. Why should non-religious families feel threatened by this? I am not threatened by my children learning about evolution, in fact, I embrace the diversity in their lives. Teach your children your beliefs at-home, tell them not to be embarrassed of expressing themselves and to be tolerant and open-minded to all people, regardless of race, religion or socio-economic status. Teach them to follow their hearts and seek out their own truths. And, in the end, if your child wants to pray--possibly for a child that is ill, or a friend who has a parent that has lost his/her job, or a fellow student that is contemplating suicide b/c his parents are going through a divorce--by all means, encourage him or her to pray. Not all kids are taught to pray for selfish things, not all prayers that reach Heaven are for &quot;good grades&quot;, possibly, some of the prayers that reach Heaven are for you!? I have spent many years working to preserve my beliefs in a family that doesn't agree with me. I do not force my opinions on them, I do not pray out loud when they join me for a meal at my table, I do not crank up my Christian music when they ride in my car—but, I stand firm in my beliefs and command respect for what I chosen to believe. I will never make fun of them or condemn them for not believing in prayer or God--I expect the very same in return. Please ponder my words.
