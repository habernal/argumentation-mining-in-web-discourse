I mean you can talk to a friend or a family member or a stranger about religion and ninety eight percent of the time are against what you're saying and thats how we all start a fight. I mean I believe in God, but I have my ways of thinking that I dont think everybody should be talking about religion or bringing a bible to school nor work because there are people that does not believe in God, there are people out there that believes in evolution or anything out there, and since there are people that are against the bible or talking about God (religion) in a public area thats why we have war going on, hating on each other, killing everybody. I mean look at the example at Israel, there are like three or four different types of religions there and they all hate each other and against each other, they're all in war now because of the religion. I think that's ridicioulous for people to be doing that, like I said earlier for that don't talk about God nor bring a bible to a public area. Yes, I understand there are people that like to help people to understand there's a God out there and to help the people to become a better person, but hey what can you do? They choose what they want to do, either they want to follow that path or go the other way, it's their choose not ours.
