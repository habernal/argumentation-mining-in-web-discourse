From the first day of Kindergarten until the last day of 12th grade. Homeschooling is a personal choice. My parents chose to home-school me for religious reasons, but unlike your friend I was not sheltered to the extreme. My parents told me what the believed, why they believed it and let me make up my own mind about life. While living under their roof I'm not allowed to drink, cuss, sleep-around etc due to siblings growing up in my home. I feel as an 18 year old, with a book being published, and several public school attending friends and family that I did better home-schooled than I would in a public school environment. I worked best being able to push /myself/ to my own extent, successfully completing high school in 2 1/2 years with a 4.0 grade average. I have heard people say that just because you are home-schooled means you are not as smart. I beg to differ. I obviously would not have made good grades on my SAT or achieved a college pass in Jr. high-school had I been &quot;dumber&quot; than public school students. &#10;Unlike some of you, being around public school students does not bother me.&#10;I however do not feel comfortable in a extreme peer-pressure type relationship, where everyone is pushing you to do this or that.  But so does most people. &#10;As for not knowing how people get pregnant, watching PG-13 movies etc. I was not allowed to watch PG-13 movies until I was 13. My parents opinion was the 13 was put there on purpose. lol &#10;I had &quot;the talk&quot;  when I was 5 years old with a not very nice 7 year old cousin, that had learned about it at school and who was being a know it all. So my parents just made the best they could of the situation and explained more as I got older. &#10;I agree. Being so sheltered at 16 years of age? Well... that has its debatable points. I do not, have not, and will not ever, consider myself to be &quot;wise in the way's of the world&quot; but I am not oblivious either. I know about more than most people think I do. I have been called &quot;immature&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot; by some people, because of my religious views on the matter. And even been called an &quot;extremist&quot;. But I feel that statement is wrong. An extremist is someone who believes public school is wrong, someone who believes you shouldn't educate your children to know about &quot;certain&quot; things, someone who believes that a 16 year old should be in the position your friend is in. I, do not. &#10;Another point that has been brought out, that I agree with. Is that to home-school a child just to teach them your views on the world. Is wrong. If you feel your child needs to be educated in those things, that is perfectly acceptable. But that shouldn't be a basis for not putting them in school. However if you want to use a christian curriculum that is your decision. My parents did not. And I am grateful they didn't. Not because those books are less &quot;acceptable&quot; but because I enjoyed reading the same books my cousins were reading, doing the same type of work they were doing, etc. &#10;I for one, if I live in the same neighborhood when I have children /will/ put them in either a private school, or home school them. Due to high drug trafficking, rape stats, etc. (( and yes some religious reasons )) I just wouldn't feel comfortable sticking my child into that atmosphere. But due to needing social skills, friends, and experience with people, I would be more likely to stick them in a private school. &#10;Having said all that, and written a novelette which I hadn't intended to do. I contend that I am very glad I was home-schooled, and that I believe it is a personal preference whether you home-school your child or choose some other form of education.
