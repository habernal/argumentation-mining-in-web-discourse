I travelled 2 hours each way, my friends lived 40 or more minutes away so I never got to see them outside school, and my school spent more time worrying about our hats and top buttons being done up and churning us out to get married than developing a career. I never got to learn useful things like home science, or biology (it wasn't offered!) while my friends at the local high school got to learn dance as a subject, had local friends and all ended up with awesome careers. Strangely I'm now more friends with local high school people I've met but never went to school with rather than the snobby rich bitches who wouldn't speak to me as I wasn't from the right suburb. Local kids had way more advantages, they seriously don't realise it. My parents could have save thousands and thousands on wasted education expenses. I do really appreciate what they sacrificed to get me there, but personally I don't think I benefitted much from it. &#10;Yeah, I went to a private school as well. Long travel times, distant friends, limited educational opportunities. Now I teach in the public system and the teachers and kids are amazing and it only takes me 10 minutes to drive to work. &#10;Of course there are plenty of people in our community who have taken the bait of private schools. The fact is it's more about keeping up with the Joneses than receiving a better education. &#10;Yeah except my experience is a bit different - my parents were dying so they sent me to a city private boarding school when I was 14 - I remember maybe 6 months later one day I went to the local city public pool and happened to see someone from my old country school - 'how's it going?' - 'um - since you've left everyone in your class is either married or pregnant' - OMG ! - I thanked my lucky stars ... &#10;Maybe 25 years later I went back to my old country town for a school reunion - got the award for 'furthest traveled' - looked around, and 80% of my class had not moved outside the small town, and everyone else no further than the closest city - I felt blessed that I had the opportunity of a wider experience &#10;but yes I agree that outside the 'old boys network' for lawyers and commerce degrees, most gained no advantage from private schools, and many ended up rather socially damaged individuals due to some kind of abuse they suffered during the closeted experience of boarding school - so I won't recommend it. &#10;Admin and Nicko. The mistake your parents made was sending you to the wrong school, not sending you to a private school. I sent one kid to a private school and another to a public school. I chose the school that was in the bests interests of the child and suited their personality, needs and interests. It has worked well. Don't blame the school for your poor experience. &#10;And I was a public school victim. A very bright kid whose marks and attitude to school were dragged down by a school culture where being intelligent was ridiculed. &#10;My childhood aim was to be a vet and I might have made it except that my grade 11/12 chemistry marks tanked as my teacher had months off due to illness and the school didn't bother to replace him. We just sat there with our textbooks trying to learn. I wouldn't have happened at your private school would it?
