My siblings are natural learners; they have a curiosity towards science, reading, writing, and they like to explore and challenge themselves and don't always have to be prompted to do so. I, on the other hand, am a serial procrastinator/lazy person to the point where I will spend hours reading about the world's most haunted places, watching Buffy on netflix, and eating cereal if given any amount of free time. You can see where this is bad when it comes to me directing my own schooling. &#10;That's pretty much why I decided to enroll in an online school...I have deadlines, assignments, and I work well under those types of constraints. If I don't have a teacher telling me to turn in my rough draft or 3 pages of math problems now then I won't study, or read, or do anything particularly productive. I guess you could say that I sort of have the best of both worlds - I get an education and school transcript but I can still sleep in till 9 and wear pajamas all day if I wanted. &#10;So yeah, it's all in the way that you home-school that matters, I think. I don't agree with the parents who home-school their children and shelter them completely from the outside world. I mean, obviously if you home-school your kids you're sort of passing on your own values to them rather than the values that a public school might, but you don't really have the right to never let them/not push them to socialize, or go crazy about monitoring everything they listen to/watch/read, or withhold information about sex, dating, and the 'real world' from them. Protective/cautious I get, but when you're pre-reading books for your teenager who's never been educated about birth control or how to deal with people who are different than them in mindset/religion/political affiliation/etc? That's what I have a problem with. I actually have family members who do this to their (teenaged) children and it irritates me to watch. &#10;Anyway, I think it goes without saying that I don't mean to offend, but you said debate, and I'm pretty good at that :) "/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2264" language="en" documentId="423" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="AgentReyes" date="October 23, 2013 10:56" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://nanowrimo.org/forums/age-group-teens/threads/128227?page=1" topic="homeschooling" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="423" notes="" title="Homeschooling - debate"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="93"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="94" end="729"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="730" end="1219"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="1220" end="2143"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="2144" end="2264"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55"/></xmi:XMI>
