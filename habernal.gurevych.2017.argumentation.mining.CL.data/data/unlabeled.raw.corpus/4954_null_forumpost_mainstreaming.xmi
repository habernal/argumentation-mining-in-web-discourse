I know it seems I am rushing everythingit's just after watching DS suffer at two nurseries before this one we're at now, I don't want to watch him regress again so want to be sure that everything possible is in place for him to give him the best chance - especially if it's mainstream. &#10;Thanks for letting me know it's usually termly for you, that seems to be the general thing. His term has just finished so perhaps I'm being a *tad*impatient and will have to see if they approach me after the break. (That will be a full term, Jan-April.) &#10;I'm in touch with the SENCo at the school and nursery (same one) and she and I both came up with the first targets on the IEP together, there were 2, though one of them was a lot more in depth than another. He's met both very easily because they were simple things - being able to be left (me go as I was staying for the first few weeks) and him not only tolerating it, but being happy to stay and give me a kiss goodbye etc. &#10;He's been at the point where both have been met for a while, which hopefully explains my impatient behaviours... &#10;We've been to the other school (specialised), and a lady from the school has come out to the house, she did advise us and they are all lovely. &#10;Anyway, I do have a gut feeling that when in school he's going to need 1-1 at all times. Breaks included - especially, actually, as this is when he may suffer with sensory overload and is most likely to injur himself (does self-harm) or someone else. If this is provided, he'll probably do very well in mainstream academically. &#10;However, if his breaks are restricted then he wont get the socialisation or the acceptance - not really, even if he goes through mainstream without any bullying and just gets on with it, he isn't going to be able to take part in group activities and form bonds with children who not only accept that he is different, but understand. This socialisation is only going to happen in a special school and the staff in this environment are also going to be very understanding and a lot more experienced and have lots of ideas. As are the parents of what would be DS's classmates. &#10;They do accommodate all children - DS too has &quot;above age average intelligence&quot; so it's for all children with an ASD, not just the most severely affected. &#10;Which brings me back to where I was in the first place.... full circle again!! I really don't know which way to go. I know in my heart that at least for primary, this special school is going to be the best possible choice for him to progress and do well, however much I would like it to be mainstream, I don't think it's going to happen. Many of the kids who go there end up doing more than OK in mainstream high school anyway, so that's something to work towards. &#10;I've been told by the staff at child development and by the outreach worker that it IS possible to apply direct to the special school for a place. Though they are over-subscribed and so my chances of getting there without the Statement ofSEN is minimal, even with the statement it's touch and go. The application process though will be entirely different and we wont be able to list other choices... so if the outcome was No, you can't have a place at the SEN School then we would be stuck as where DS is now is out of catchment and limited spaces are available as it is so small... so we could end up being offered somewhere we really, really don't want him to go. &#10;God, I know I am confusingbut I really can't make up my mind whether to keep on as I am and pray for the best with mainstream, and risk having to go through some more challenges if it doesn't work or push harder to get the statement and go straight to specialised? That's the dilemma. I need to stay on top of everything and hurry my head up and make a decision because it really is down to these two schools only. &#10;Thanks for the time, sorry for all the rambling, just need to get it out and re-read it... perhaps I'll find out what to do that way.
