In other words, don't start kindergarten at age 5, then freak out that your kid is too young for first grade and hold him/her back (unless the kid simply failed to comprehend what was taught). And if you do do this, just don't put the kid in school at all for the year. Keep him at home. What's he going to do back in kindergarten? Learn the ABCs all over again? Might as well get him a job as an assistant teacher. My daughter finished kindergarten at 5 years old, turning six in late June. My wife wanted to put her back in kindergarten and I wouldn't have it. She successfully learned everything taught, so repeating kindergarten would be nothing more than a waste of time. Yes, she is more immature than the older kids, but so far she learns just as well and is doing fine. &#10;Everyone ought to be held back from all schooling until about 10 years old. This way, instead of stretching out learning something like the alphabet over the course of a year, a kid can learn it in a few weeks. It took my daughter an entire year to learn the alphabet in pre-K. As an adult, I learned the entire Russian alphabet in a couple of days. Early schooling is nothing more than free daycare as far as learning goes. However, kids do like playing with other kids, so school does have social benefits. A ten year old could probably catch up on learning everything taught between the ages of 3 and 9 by the end of his first year in school. Keep in mind that he would have been learning plenty just from normal living.
