Where I live the public schools are run by politics... and just like in our country that means that nothing good is getting done as each side ends up only pushing for their own agenda.   Where does this leave the kids?  Well I will tell you the public school board could care less about the kids as they are only interested in getting  elected again.   Now as to this post, when I send my child to a private school, I am still going to be invested in the public school.   Not only will I be paying for my child to go to school, I will also be funding other kids to go to public schools.   Why should I do any more than that?   Should I send my daughter to a public school where I would have to worry about her every day?   I think that if I put my daughter in a place where I have to fight for her to get a good education.. when the government is doing all they can to cut the teachers and their pay... and there are so many bad kids... then that would make me a bad parent.   Choosing to support my daughter and give her a better chance at an education, where she will be safer, and will have a better future, only makes me a good parent.    Now you may say this does not make me a good supporter of the community kids, but they still get my funds every other week when I get paid.   It is not my job to put my daughters life / future / education at risk so that your kids can maybe benefit from her being in their class.   It is your job, to help your kids not mine.
