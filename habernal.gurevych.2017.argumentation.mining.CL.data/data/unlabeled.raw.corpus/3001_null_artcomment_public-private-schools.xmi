Teachers were quick to say &quot;...well then your child needs to be on ADHD medication if they're having problems.&quot;..when all I asked for was a bit of extra help. I called Bull$#!+, told them how ineffective their teaching methods are...&amp; even after arguing with them that my child does not have ADHD, the school STILL did their own &quot;test&quot; (not believing that I as her mother would know if she was). After they tested, they tell me, &quot;Oh well we ruled out ADHD.&quot; Talk about pissed off! I work in a clinic, &amp; the number of ADHD patients we see in a day's time is ASTOUNDING! I truely believe that more than half of these kids are mis-diagnosed...&amp; those parents half the time are referred from the school nurses! I've heard parents tell doctors, &quot;This is basically saying that the state wants my child on medication!&quot; In the years that my daughter has been in private school, I have noticed (by talking with a lot of parents), that only a few students in the entire school are actually ADHD positive. Whereas in public school, 20 of the 25 kids in just my daughter's class are on medication! Hmmm   My daughter has been doing so well in private school...a solid education without all the &quot;politics&quot;, federal &amp; state regulations, budget cuts, stale teaching agenda, etc. I'm thankful that the school has a tuition assistance program, &amp; all I do to qualify for the program is to accumulate a certain amount of volunteer hours, which is the easy part...I have always been involved in my daughter's education &amp; activities. Even if I didn't have the assistance option, I would still have her in the private school, no matter what I had to sacrifice...as a working-class American, I am allowed to make those choices. Whatever is in my means to provide the best for my child, I will do! I've taken more than necessary steps as a parent within the public school system to see some changes &amp; they just do not listen...HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO SUPPORT A SYSTEM THAT JUST TURNS THE PARENTS AWAY?
