Because of where her birthday falls, she would only have been eligible for a 2 y/o program, even though she was turning 3 not long after the start of the school year. Therefore, she was in a classroom with kids who were (technically) a year older with regards to the academic year. It really worried me at the time; she seemed not just on par with these &quot;older&quot; kids, but actually a good bit ahead of some of them in many different areas. I was really worried that if she seemed so far ahead of these kids, it would be even worse when she was in that same class the following year with kids who were even younger. &#10;However, after watching what my niece went through, I was in no rush to push her ahead either. I didn't want to set her up to be starting kindergarten, and be not just a year, but in some cases, two years younger than some of her classmates. Physically, that can be a huge difference, and she is already on the smaller side as it is. &#10;I got lucky - all but one of the kids in her current preschool class also has a fall birthday shortly after that Sept 1 cut-off. So although she is technically in a 2 y/o program, all of them were actually 3 by December. Molly is still a bit ahead of them with regards to some of the &quot;academic&quot; type stuff, but it is not as drastic as I had feared it would be. Truthfully, that wasn't really my goal for sending her to preschool anyway. I was doing it more for the social aspects (learning to share, take turns, play with others, etc.) that, as an only child, I felt she needed. I also wanted her to be able to do this without my presence. &#10;She has absolutely loved it, and it has been a HUGE benefit for her."/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1886" language="en" documentId="5070" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Mary" date="03/19/2012" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://www.circleofmoms.com/debating-mums/redshirting-for-kindergarten-688687" topic="redshirting" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="5070" notes="" title="Redshirting for Kindergarten?"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="73"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="74" end="841"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="842" end="1176"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="1177" end="1817"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="1818" end="1886"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55"/></xmi:XMI>
