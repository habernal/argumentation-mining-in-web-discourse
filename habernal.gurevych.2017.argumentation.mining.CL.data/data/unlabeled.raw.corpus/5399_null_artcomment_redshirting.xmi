We sent him to kindergarten when he was 5, not thinking that his age would be an issue since his birthday was 3 months before the cutoff. As it turned out, he was (and still is) one of the youngest kids in his class, and he is among the youngest two or three boys (out of 100 kids). There have been kids in his class every year that are a full year older than him. Academically and behaviorally, he has not had issues. Socially, kindergarten was really tough. But some of that is him. He’s in second grade now and he still has problems socially. I think if we had waited till he was 6 to start kindergarten, he might have had fewer social issues, but he also would have been really bored. &#10;It’s a really hard decision to make, maybe one we didn’t think enough about. I think some of it is geographic too. Around here (in NC), there seems to be a real trend to give kids another year of preschool. I know kids that have March and April birthdays that go to kindergarten at age 6. I’m not a fan of the trend, personally, because I think it changes expectations. If we really want to do this, we should change the cutoff so everyone is on equal footing. I like a PP’s suggestion of having to justify holding a kid back.
