Parents are not supposed to be TELLING the teachers what to teach or how to handle the students.  We have laws and they have rules and regulations based on the laws we voted on.  As for a written curriculum, you can get on the state education websites to find out what has to be taught at each grade levels.  I am a parent who chooses private over public.  I am Catholic and the Catholic faith believes if the parents aren't able to provide their children with the proper faith teaching necessary, then they should try everything they can to educate them in a Catholic school.  It is not a requirement.  My husband isn't even Catholic but likes the class size and support we have received.  We are not rich and live modestly (our cars are 15 and 20 years old) to ensure we have the funds for private school.  We don’t receive any kind of aid.  In addition, our school doesn't have nearly the programs or opportunities that the public school kids have.  I have to take the time off from work to drive my daughter to and from the Gifted Students program held at…wait for it…the public school since 1) our taxes pay for it and 2) the private school system doesn’t have a program like it.  But...what the private schools do have is HUGE parental involvement.  It isn't the money that the public schools need...what it needs are parents who support the school and teachers by encouraging their children in performing homework, being involved with extracurricular activities as well as performing volunteer hours - that's right VOLUNTEER your time.  Instead of saying I have had an exhausting day and just want time for me, get involved.  Find out what the school or teachers need help with.  Talk to your child about school.  Have them show you what they are doing.  Find tasks you can do together that incorporates learning.  TURN OFF the TV and COMPUTERS.  Stop your &quot;what's in it for me&quot; attitude.  Our society has tanked because each new generation isn't learning how to be a moral, conscientious citizen; they are learning how to get things without working for them or how to scream fowl without looking at the big picture – as I believe Ms Benedikt is or by turning a blind eye to what could be done.  There are multiple sides to this issue of public vs. private but in no way will the returning to public schools by these families be the catalyst or solution to the public school problems.  It is Ms Benedikt’s views and those of parents who want to blame the problem on the “rich” parents or, in our case, the “involved” parents rather than look to the parents already in the public school system and say “what can be done to involve them.”  How can we involve those parents who aren’t stepping up to help and how can we instill in the next generation how to be that type of parent? Have you heard the saying…We must lead by EXAMPLE!!!!
