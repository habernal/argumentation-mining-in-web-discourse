Even with aides, a teacher often has to slow down and/or pause the lesson to address certain disruptive behaviors (saw this in my dcs' class last year, which had multiple inclusion students, some of whom were non-verbal &amp; had daily tantrums &amp; outbursts). Having those distractions (not to mention having additonal aides in the room) can be counterproductive to other students. &#10;The reg. classroom teacher, who often is not special ed certified, has his/her resources &amp; abilities stretched to try to accommodate the special needs in their class. Often, those who do well academically/behaviorally are often left on their own unless a parent continually advocates for their dcs in order to ensure that things are done to help them reach their full potential. &#10;As wonderful as it is that students want to help take care of the inclusion students, calming down another student means that the child doing that is taking time away from his/her own learning, not the mention the initial distraction that the outburst created. The fact of the matter is that doing so (calming down a student) is not their job or their responsibility. Some schools, though, such as my dcs', will repeatedly place a reg. ed kid w/the same inclusion student if it feels that doing so is beneficial to the inclusion student without discussing with the parents of the reg. ed. child whether doing so is desired by them &amp; beneficial for their child. &#10;I understand &amp; support the desire of parents to have their dcs, regardless of abilities (high or low), in the most beneficial educational environment possible and I know that I made some broad statements/gave examples that obviously doesn't apply to every inclusion situation. I do agree with others who said inclusion does need to be done/evaluated on an individual basis. However, I think that the evaluation/decision needs to weigh the impact that inclusion will have on the class as a whole...not just whether it's good for that one child....because, imo, inclusion to benefit 1 at the expense of others is wrong.
