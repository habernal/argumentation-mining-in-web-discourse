Setting aside the obvious ethical limitations of this argument, I think the practical implications belie the real effort put into homeschooling one's children. It would be impossible for me to put the same level of effort and resources into the public school system as I do into homeschooling my own children without simultaneously suffering a blow to our quality of life. Homeschooling isn't a few hours of volunteering time per week. It's my job. The only reason I will not have a full time job once all my children are school aged is because I will be homeschooling. Should I really be expected to abstain from working in order to donate 100% of my time to improving education for society and public school children in general? Is the same standard expected of parents with full time careers and public schooled kids? I think the only way this suggestion can be made is by completely undermining the commitment and and work required of many homeschoolers. Homeschooling takes so much time, effort, and resources that it precludes my ability and desire to hold down a full time job at the same time, while also attending to the needs of my children, my home, my husband, and myself. Why should I be expected to instead donate that time, that effort, and the possibility of a full time paycheck to the public school system? We are comfortable with the idea of forgoing an additional full time paycheck and the benefits it would entail in order for me to donate that time and effort to our children's personalized, individualized education instead. Doing the same for public schools would not only force my children to give up that education, but force my family to give up the extra resources and opportunities of another paycheck.
