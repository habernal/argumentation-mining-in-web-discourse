In her full article she states she is &quot;not an education policy wonk...just judgmental.&quot; She also goes on to say she is &quot;proud&quot; or her ignorance, that she read only one book during her entire high school career, that she was woefully unprepared for college, that she left college without having learned much there either, that she knows nothing about poetry, very little about art, and  she requests not to be quizzed on the dates of the Civil War. Nevertheless, she has the authority to lecture us on education. Oh, she says she is doing fine. Yes, she is fine if your definition of fine is obtaining a mediocre education in the public school system.  So, why would anyone want to listen to someone who admits the being proud of her ignorance on the subject which she writes? If indeed we are bad people for sending our children to private schools, it may come as a surprise to Ms. Benedikt that public school teachers, as a profession, send their kids to public schools in a greater ratio than any other profession. Following Benedikt's logic, that makes many school teachers &quot;bad people&quot;. Isn't it our duty, as parents, to protect our children from &quot;bad people&quot;? Public education is already a monopoly. Benedikt's suggestion would make it more so. Can you name one monopoly that puts out a great product and is responsive to its end-users? If anyone has been involved in attempting to make any changes within the public school system, as I have, finds it nearly impossible to affect any meaningful change whatsoever. Benedikt's manifesto would make it virtually impossible to do so. Our kids have only one chance for a good education and if you are a good parent you will make the choice you feel would give your child the best chance to be successful in life. Otherwise, they may all end up writing for Slate.
