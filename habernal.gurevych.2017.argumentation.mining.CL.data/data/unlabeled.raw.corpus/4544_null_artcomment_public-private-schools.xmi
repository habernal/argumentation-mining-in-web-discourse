Standards and discipline have fallen off the cliff, such that they no longer provide an environment conducive towards learning. TheSystem no longer aspires to achieving excellence rather it has become a damage limitation exercise, which on the one hand seeks to limit further deterioration of the public system and on the other hand seeks to handicap the private system so that the gap between the two doesn't continue to expand. &#10;Only good part of the public system is the selective entry performance orientated public schools like JamesRuse and MelbourneHigh. However by their very nature these are effectively not public schools but rather 100% government funded private schools. Only difference between them and their private school brethren is whether they are allowed to charge parents fees. Analyse the public system without inclusion of these schools and the situation is far worse than being portrayed. &#10;There's still a demand for public schools however it's entirely for these selective entry schools. State governments for whatever reason cannot or will not provide extra funds to expand this sector (ideological or education union pressure). If proponents of public education are really serious about stemming the flow of students then they should be calling for the creation of more selective entry schools, and not opposing them on ideological grounds and attempting a big socialist experiment on other peoples children. &#10;In every other field of endeavour the consumer is always correct and over time, provided with a better and better product. Only exception is in the field of public non-tertiary education. Consumers are told that they are wrong and have to accept the mandated stock standard product. And Instead of providing a service that has improved over time, standards have significantly decreased.
