Obviously I couldn´t understand everything that you have been through over the last 17 years and it sounds like a tremendous struggle, and has been very difficult for you, but to imply that unless you have lived a particular set of circumstances your opinion on a subject invalid is an odd stance to me, in this way no one would have be able to comment on any historical events, or even any current affairs. &#10;My comment about only parents being able to make decisions on behalf of their children, I was rather thinking that the state imposes decisions and expects certain behaviour from us all the time, children and adults. In a national curriculum, the state makes decisions about what sort of things children should learn. Children whether home educated or otherwise have to undergo exams to show certain standards of learning, devised by the state or other bodies that the parents have nothing to do with. On this basis therefore, I don´t see why the state should not be more actively involved in monitoring standards amongst home educated children during the education, and not just at exam time. I agree that this has not always been done sympathetically, and needs to change. &#10;Having been to a faith school, I actually do have an opinion on them, and feel that I should be able to comment on this, as others with differing opinions should also be able to comment. However this thread is not the place to enter that debate. &#10;I cannot accept your argument that parental will should be the only determining factor when deciding on education arrangements for the child. But I´m free to have this opinion, as you are to have yours, and I´m sorry you don´t feel I &quot;consider&quot; my comments. I actually am genuinely interested in the issue of home schooling, and I´m trying to learn something from this forum, and being told that I should &quot;leave the home educators alone&quot; because I have a different opinion to you, I find unhelpful. &#10;The only thing that I can agree with you is that there is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to education.
