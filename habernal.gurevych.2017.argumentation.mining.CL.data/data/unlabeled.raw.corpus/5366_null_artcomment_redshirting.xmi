My parents did not hold me back even though I was small for my age. My dad was afraid that our relatives would think that there was something mentally 'wrong' with me. My mother wanted to hold me back a year- I think that she could see the handwriting on the wall. However, he won out. In kindergarten, I wet my pants 1 day during school; my dad had to leave work to come take me home. (At the time, my mother worked, too, &amp; we only had 1 car). In addition to being the youngest &amp; smallest child in the class, I was emotionally immature as well. My 1st grade teacher recommended that I repeat first grade, even tho I'd passed everything academically. But again, I was sent on. My 2nd grade report card said, &quot; 1. Donna talks when others are talking 2. hits other children 3. stays close to tears.&quot; I passed all my classes, tho, &amp; was promoted. The rest of elementary school, my teachers constantly complained that I daydreamed in class. I was always the last one chosen for dodgeball, kickball, etc. at recess. My growth started to catch up &amp; normalize in h.s., but the damage was done. I never was comfortable when trying to socialize. Had a terrible self-image. Even now, decades later, I'm not spontaneous when conversing. I run the sentences thru my head before I speak. By then, the subject has likely changed. I was, of course, the last one to get a driver's license. I never went to any dances in the gym Fri. nights after f'ball games. Athletics for girls were frowned on in our house; it wasn't considered 'lady-like' by my mother. Looking back, I think there were just too many things I had to overcome. A friend of mine had a sister who was a teacher. She had a son with a borderline birthday. She &amp; her husband sent him on to kindergarten as soon as they could. At the end of the school-year, his teacher said she could not in good conscience send him onto 1st grade. So he spent another year in k'garten. My brother-in-law, long since grown, has a Dec. birthday. He still wishes his parents had held him back a year. He hated being the last kid in his grade to get his D.L. plus being younger than all the girls. After I had my 1st son, my husband &amp; I talked often about when he should start kindergarten. He had a mid-July birthday. ( Nowadays, a child has to be 5 by the 1st day of school). Where I live, that's in early August now. We pretty much have year -round school. I asked my husband what would be the worst thing that could happen if we sent him to k'garten when he was barely 5. He said he could fail. I said no. The worst thing is that he could PASS. Why? He would spend his entire school 'career' STRUGGLING to keep up! And I KNEW what that was like! And, because he was a boy, he'd most likely be slower to mature than a girl would. On the other hand, if after he were held back, he proved to be a GENIUS, he could always 'skip' a grade, &amp; be placed in a class with kids born the same year. We ended up keeping him in pre-school an extra year. This is MUCH easier than holding a child back once he is in regular school. His education worked out well. He liked being the oldest in his grade. He was the 1st to get his driver's license. He wasn't younger than all the girls in his class, when the time came to think about dating. I'm glad we made the decision to hold him back. We did the same with his brother 3 years later. It's been great both times. I would do it again in a heartbeat.
