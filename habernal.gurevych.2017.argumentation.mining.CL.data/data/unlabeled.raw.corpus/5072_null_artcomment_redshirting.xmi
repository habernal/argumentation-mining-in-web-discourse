It won't be an issue for me; my daughter will be one of the older kids in her class just because of where her birthday falls. However, it was an issue for my sister with both of her kids. &#10;In her state (and also mine) the age cut-off is September 1st. Both of her kids have mid-August birthdays. My niece is the older of the two, and they did not delay her kindergarten start. It was a decision that my sister really questioned the first 3 years the girl was in school. In those years, my niece has some significant struggles. In first grade, about halfway through the school year, her teacher suggested that they may want to consider holding the girl back a year. My sister was not only upset by this, but also a little bit bewildered. My niece was actually a rather bright girl, but she seemed to be struggling to hold her own in comparison to many of her classmates. It took her a bit longer to &quot;get&quot; some of the things that her classmates seemed to grasp so easily. It wasn't until my sister really looked into this that she realized that over half of the girl's class was over a year older than she was. She already would have been on the young side to begin with, since her birthday was so close to the cut-off, but combined with the fact that so many parents are now choosing to delay a year, she was over a full year younger than many of them. At this age, that difference can be huge. &#10;Luckily, it all seemed to even out for my niece by the end of second grade. As I said, she is an unusually bright kid, and now that she is in fourth grade, she is actually at the top of her class academically. Gym and physical play are still a bit of any issue, since many of her peers are physically bigger than she is, and my sister says that she feels that she is also emotionally and socially a bit behind some of her friends, but she is otherwise happy and thriving now. &#10;When it came time to send my nephew to school, who also has an August birthday, they didn't hesitate to hold him back after their experience with my niece. They really didn't feel as if they had a choice. He is a bit more impulsive and unruly (my sister is sure he will probably be worked up for ADHD at some point). He's &quot;smart&quot;, but nearly as much so as his sister, and was definitely more developmentally immature than she was at the same age. He truly would have been at a disadvantage if thrown into an environment where a good number of his peers were over a year older. He is now in first grade, and has had a much smoother transition into school than my niece did. &#10;Did they &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; to delay his start? They may not have, if everyone sent their kid to school when they were of age. However, because so many people are holding their kids back, they didn't feel as if they had a choice.
