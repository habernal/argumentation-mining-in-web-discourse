The truth is that as far as schools go and providing our children with a good education, it is far &quot;easier&quot; (and I am clearly NOT talking about finances here) to send our child to a proven and excellent private school than it would be to become activists at the local public schools.  Personally, I experienced both in education.  Public from a really bad neighborhood in the South Bronx (no kidding here) and then off to a top notch college preparatory HS in Connecticut (academic scholarship).  The difference in quality of education was immeasurable and further still the culture shock I endured.....but it was the best thing that could have happened to me.  Now here I am many many years later with children of my own and the truth is that private school is more appealing because it bypasses all the crap that really does exist in public schools today. But please people, do not think that private schools are void of their own issues too.  My oldest son, now in college, was actually pulled from the very school that Trayvon Martin went to, and placed in private school.  While the education was superior academically and overall the kids just had better heads on their shoulders, the fact that many had money made it easier for them to access fake IDs, and more illicit drugs such as cocaine.
