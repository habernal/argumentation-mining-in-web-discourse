People would not pay fees for a private education unless there was an advantage to doing so. While it is true some private schools do not deliver in line with their fees (i.e. the most money does not deliver the best students), a major draw card is discipline. which the publci system has dropped the ball on. Education as a right comes with associated obligations, which include supporting the teaching staff in handling the kids, and students actually making an effort tolearn, and not disrupt others. &#10;Yes: but how far is the advantage they buy an advantage for their children, educationally or socially? That's the question posed here. &#10;I feel sorry for too many kids who are turned into status symbols for their parents while being taught conformity and (for many) the arrogance of privilege. &#10;peter1 parents are not buying advantage just a safe place to learn without as much bullying&#10;The choice for us was overcrowded local schools where kids are actually masturbating in the playgrounds, girls dress length leaves little to the imagination, and sexting and swearing are standard, or low fee Christian school with a uniform policy based on &quot;modesty&quot; (remember that?), a loving disciplinary system and families comfortable with the overtly Christian world view. If this is elitist, I'm happy with the label. &#10;yes because consumers are always rational&#10;@Joel, not at all - the advantage only needs to be perceived, not actual. And I wonder how good an education can be if it's not able, or not willing, to teach that distinction. &#10;Both Joel &amp; Peter1 make valid points on both sides of the argument.&#10;I suspected, abc, from your comments about football that you have little actual experience with private schools. Now I know so. Sending a kid to a private school because there is less bullying there - that's gold. &#10;Its not public schools tht have dropped the ball on discipline, it is the political and legal structures that give teachers little leeway to really make any serious changes. Try getting someone explelled, I was assaulted by a student and they got a single day's suspension becasue it was a first ofence. Persuasion is the oil of the public school classroom, something that has its limits. However, despite this most students in the public schoos I have taught at and still teach in are civilised, warm, accepting human &#10;I find some of the comments extolling the virtues of private schools hilarious! I went to a Catholic girls school and to claim that there was better behaviour both in class and outside than in state schools is just laughable. Girls were smoking cigarettes in the toilets every day and some were smoking marijuana; two teachers had to leave with nervous breakdowns because of the bullying of students; many girls from our class were highly promiscuous and there were several pregnancies despite the 'modesty' propaganda. This school was in an upper middle class suburb. My husband also went to a Christian Brothers high school. Their brutality is one reason we sent our children to state schools. I originally sent two of my children to Catholic primary schools but left there for a state primary school. I have never regretted for one second that all four of my children have gone to state high and primary schools. The quality of their education has been excellent and they have had to deal with everyone at their school. All the bullying my children have suffered occurred in the Catholic schools. None of them have been bullied in the state schools they have attended.
