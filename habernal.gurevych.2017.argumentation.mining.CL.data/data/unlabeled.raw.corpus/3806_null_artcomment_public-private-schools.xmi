What does she mean the parents are bad? Who is she kidding herself. Does she feel guilty because she didn't send her own children to private school?   I went through 7 and 1/2 years of private school. Then finish in public school. The reason for this is because we moved. We sent our three children through eight years   of private school, then they finished in public school, here again because we moved. In each case money was a factor. If we could have afforded it we would have finished sending them to private school.  In private school they did get a better education than they did in public school. So the years spent in private school was a good foundation for their remaining years in public school.  How many famous people in public and private life went to private school and are good people?  My husband and I are so bad that we have never been arrested, or have gotten in any trouble. We are so bad that our children married and has good partners, and beautiful families. We are so bad that one of their partners is in public live trying to make his community a better community. We are so bad that our children do not suffer from going to private school.
