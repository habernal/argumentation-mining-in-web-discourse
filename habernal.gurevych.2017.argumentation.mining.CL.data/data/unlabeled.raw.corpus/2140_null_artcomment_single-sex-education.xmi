When we did merge in the final year of junior school I was given my first real lesson in gender politics in that the female headmistress was dismissed and the male headmaster kept on. My High school was very academic but also encouraged interest in a range of sports and musical instruments. I have worked on the Board of various organisations since and trained in the traditionally masculine field of Finance. Yet I have rarely had a problem with gender sterotypes from staff working to me. This might be in part because the UK had an elected woman Prime Minsiter for years as well as a reigning female sovereign, both of whom were married with children. &#10;I cannot recall a single girl getting pregnant whilst at school. In fact there was no peer pressure whatsoever to have sex. I am glad we did not have proms either. They must be great if you are popular but an absolute nightmare for the shy or the lonely who have no-one to go with. &#10;There was bullying which can happen anywhere. However because we were small enough to fit into a single hall and hold daily assembles, we knew each other by sight. &#10;If I had had a daughter I would have wanted her to go to a school like mine."/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1269" language="en" documentId="2140" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Rare Affinity" date="3/11/09 3:02pm" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://jezebel.com/5168107/same+sex-education-the-separation-debate?comment=11290241#comments" topic="single-sex-education" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="2140" notes="" title="Same-Sex Education: The Separation Debate"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="744"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="745" end="1027"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="1028" end="1192"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="1193" end="1269"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51"/></xmi:XMI>
