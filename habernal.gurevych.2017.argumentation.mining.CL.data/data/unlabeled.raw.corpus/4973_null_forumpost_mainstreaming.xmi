Why has someone not spoken to you about what was happening sooner? It sounds as if the school are failing in their duty to your DS and I would take this to the head ,what is happening to your boy is not acceptable. &#10;The right mainstream school can cope quite well with children who have special needs and obviously special schools have wonderful provision. Talk to the school nurse and SENCo about your son's needs and find out about the schools in your areas that may be suitable, visit them all and talk to other parents. If he has a statement then there should be regular reviews and you should be involved in these reviews, speak to the professionals involved with your son about the educational provision and the options that are available. See the information we have here. It is well worth taking a look at the booklet SEN: a guide for parents and carers, published by the Department for Education, which offers clear and reliable information about how parents can support a child a with special educational needs you can download a free copy from the link above. &#10;We have a special needs section hereand links to specialist organizations here including Downs Syndrome. You can also chat to other parents herein our special needs and disabilities forum. You are not alone and we have expert help available to support you here. If you like I can ask one of the experts from the Advisory Centre for Education (ACE) to offer help if you still feel you need it once you have explored the kinks above. &#10;The ACE advisors work on the boards offering help and support to anyone who has concerns about their child's education. &#10;ACE provides independent advice and information for parents and carers in England and Wales on a range of state education and schooling issues including exclusion, admissions, special education needs, bullying and attendance. &#10;As the children on the Special Needs/ Disability Board can face very specific issues with schooling ACE have agreed to trial an 'ASK ACE' thread on the special needs and disabilities board here. Feel free to post your education/ school questions for them on this thread and they will visit the board during the week to offer advice and support. &#10;Sonia I hope this helps a bit&#10;Very best wishes&#10;Maggie"/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2489" language="en" documentId="4973" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Maggie F(21)" date="28-06-11 12:12" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://www.netmums.com/coffeehouse/advice-support-40/special-needs-disabilities-support-502/598821-mainstream-special-needs-school-all.html" topic="mainstreaming" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="4973" notes="" title="Mainstream or Special Needs School?"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="10"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="11" end="106"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="107" end="452"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="453" end="1308"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="1309" end="1741"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="1742" end="1862"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="63" sofa="1" begin="1863" end="2089"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="2090" end="2435"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="71" sofa="1" begin="2436" end="2465"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="75" sofa="1" begin="2466" end="2482"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="79" sofa="1" begin="2483" end="2489"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59 63 67 71 75 79"/></xmi:XMI>
