In addition to the research cited in the Science article, I would like to refer interested persons to a recent Sex Roles special issue on single-sex schooling, which I co-edited along with Rebecca S. Bigler, one of the co-authors of the Science article. In part one of the special issue, available now in digital format and to be in print around November 2011, we present an overview of the controversy, along with several studies that examine the impact of single-sex schooling. Part two will be available next year, and will have more emphasis on reviews of the literature. &#10;There are many reasons for the resurgence of interest in single-sex schooling, as we discuss in the special issue part one overview (Bigler &amp; Signorella, Sex Roles, 2011). Claims of brain differences are one of those reasons, along with gender equity concerns and other issues cited by previous commenters. The question facing us now is not who started this, but whether single-sex education is indeed effective and how to assess the impact and the hypothesized causal factors. &#10;As has also been noted by other commenters, various parties in this debate have affiliations with organizations pro and con, and I am no different—I am a member of the American Council for CoEducational Schooling, and am the co-author of a previous study that failed to find benefits for single-sex schooling (Signorella, Frieze, &amp; Hershey, Psychology of Women Quarterly, 1996). I am also a member of my university’s Women’s Studies program, and have advocated for gender equity. Such associations are clearly part of the context in which the empirical evidence needs to be examined, but should not result in a priori discounting of that evidence. &#10;Margaret L.
