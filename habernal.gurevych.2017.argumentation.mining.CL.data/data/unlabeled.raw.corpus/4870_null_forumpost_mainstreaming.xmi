My youngest has GDD with a severe speech impairment and very poor motor skills. My sister and step-mother (both experienced teachers) said he needed special school but a very good friend of mine (who had been my older boys Headteacher at infants school) was very involved with the local school here and she said I should put him in that school as they were so good with SEN children. About 60% of the children have SEN and they have been great with him, especially his TA. The Foundation Stage Unit in the school is so different to a traditional reception class and most ‘work’ is done through play and it works really well for the children. He would not have coped in a more traditional class setting. &#10;We have separate infants and juniors so we had to apply for a new school for Year 3 in Sept and having visited the juniors and heard some things which worry me about it, I wasn’t happy about sending him there. I think he would struggle to cope and be a target for bullies. We then looked at the local special school which is just brilliant but I was eventually persuaded by the Ed Psych to keep him in mainstream where so far he has done well. So then we looked at the village primary schools within a reasonable distance and found one which we really liked and he is starting there in Sept in Year 3. I am expecting this to work out well as it is such a lovely small school and the staff are fantastic. &#10;I think it depends on the child’s needs and finding a school you like and where you feel you can trust the staff to meet his needs properly – having a Statement doesn’t always mean they will do what they should do! To me it wasn’t so much an issue of special school or mainstream but an issue of finding the right school for him and for now that is mainstream because we’ve found such a good school. However, when he gets as far as secondary unless there are significant improvements in his speech and motor skills, I will push for him to go to a special school as I believe he will then need to learn life skills rather than kings and queens. &#10;With the extent of problems your daughter has, lack of diagnosis shouldn’t affect her being Statemented. She obviously has some severe needs which the school would have to meet, they can’t just ignore her needs as that would put her at risk. I would look at local schools, check their websites, visit and talk to them about how they would meet her needs and see what you think. If you don’t get a good feel about somewhere then cross it off your list. All schools are different and visiting some will help you see which environment would be better for her. You might find a great mainstream school or it might make you see she needs the more specialised environment. &#10;Jayne x"/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2791" language="en" documentId="4870" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://www.parentsofdisabledchildren.co.uk/showthread.php?tid=5635" topic="mainstreaming" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="4870" notes="" title="Education should my daughter go to mainstream school or special school?"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="765"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="766" end="1470"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="1471" end="2115"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="2116" end="2783"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="2784" end="2791"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55"/></xmi:XMI>
