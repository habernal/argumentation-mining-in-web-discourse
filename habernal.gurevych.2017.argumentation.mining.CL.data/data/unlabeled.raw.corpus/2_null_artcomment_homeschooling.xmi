She attended a private, church related, Christian elementary school. For the home schooling we used the regionally accredited A Beka Academy of Pensacola Christian College. Other regionally accredited, home school curricula exist such as, for example, the excellent Seton Home School here in Virginia. During her elementary school years, our daughter took the Stanford achievement test and did well on it. Likewise, she took the Stanford test, as required by our local school system, and did well on that during her middle school and high school years. During her high school senior year, our daughter took the SAT, for college, and did well on that. She is now entering her college senior year, has been on the Dean's List since her first semester and is a member of a national college honor society. In addition to having religious reasons for privately schooling our daughter, we also had security concerns. At the local, public middle school and high school our daughter would have attended, there were numerous disciplinary problems and arrests (due to assaults, drugs, alcohol, etc.). There were at least three incidents of school staff members having inappropriate relationships with students. We did at least investigate the possibility of enrolling our daughter in public school after elementary school, however, when we kept learning of the various behavioral problems and when a police officer, of our acquaintance, pulled his children out of public school and started using private school instead, we rejected public schools. And as &quot;bad&quot; as the behavior was in our local schools, it has been even WORSE in many other Virginia school systems and even worse than those in many school systems around our nation. If public school systems want to attract families with school aged children to public schools, they have GOT to GET ALL THE VIOLENCE AND OTHER MISBEHAVIOR STOPPED.
