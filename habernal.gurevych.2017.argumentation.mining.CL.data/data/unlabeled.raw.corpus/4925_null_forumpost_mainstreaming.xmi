The staffing levels was too low and there was little training available to cope with SEN. &#10;Another which had a high percentage of children with SEN statements, and were therefore 'rewarded' with a Special Needs Unit added onto the school. This worked for some children, where they could integrate for certain classes, but have independent sessions to meet the individuals needs. But for others there was no routine and were frequently going back and forth, which became frustrating and their personal behaviour management declined. &#10;I was also placed in a Special Needs School, here the individuals needs were met with specialist trained teachers and facilities. However those who were exceptionally bright, but had physical disabilities were not particularly pushed to succeed mentally. &#10;I think the decision of mainstream or special needs school, depends on the child's needs and which facility can provide what the parent perceives to be the best opportunity for the child to grow, develop and enjoy their schooling.
