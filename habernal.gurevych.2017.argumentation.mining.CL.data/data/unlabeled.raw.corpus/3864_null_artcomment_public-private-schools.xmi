They have a voucher systems that put a private pressure on a public system. As for private schools only for the wealthy? You have a lot of assumptions about what a private school is or is not. Much of the reason is also connections who you know not what you know. Why doesn't education focus on giving you the tools to do something yourself not rely on uncle frank to get you into school or uncle joe or a classmate to get you a job?   I went to one in Canada and we were far from wealthy. 25% of the population of my alma mater is on financial aid. It is not a country club. My son is going to that school in Canada leaving what has been ranked as number 1 in the US. he is also going to a AAA rated economy and leaving one that has been AA rated for longer than any other major economic power has been before. Frankly the wealthy  public system is more exclusive than the private. Anyone who can afford to live in our town can easily pay the for private but instead they poured tons in to the local facilities and put advocacy pressure on the teachers and sports coaches relentlessly. Many of the teachers are ivy educated. the problem is it is also run by the parents and everyone is smarter than the next so it is a very political and not focused, the school has  to please everyone and I mean please. They have no core culture really and the parents are way to involved in the schooling. in private, at least my old school,  leave it to the professionals and if you do not like the culture go somewhere else or your kid does not get the job done they will kick your kid out. Try and discipline a rich kid in a rich community in a fancy public school..
