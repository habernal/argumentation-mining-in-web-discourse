My parents put 6 kids through catholic school because they had a full range of subjects plus they taught us about other religions. They tried their best to give us a good education. Public schools were over crowed even then and the teachers were doing the best they could but this was Washington D.C. our nation capital but the schools were no better then any where else. We did have the privilege of seeing protest everyday and people being taken to jail just because they didn't like something or another. So private or public school we still see our adults that run our country act like ****. I personally believe that we could and should stand up for our rights as American citizens and tell the law makers that we are tired of being told we haven't any money for our schools, we are talking about our future our children our  greatest resource and we treat them like they are a bother or that's the way the government, especially the congress they are more concerned about our private phone call, emails, and other freedoms we have lost since 9/11. Stop giving yourself raises ever chance you get and do like you forefathers' did, take a cut of your salary and donate to our school system.  You know you can take it off your taxes.  By the way you can not take your children's private school costs off your taxes anymore and be honest I couldn't find a privates school in business where I live anyway. All my children went to public school it was hard but  because I was to poor to do anything else I volunteered at there school, but it turned out to be the favorite time in my children lives.
