I was told we would have a very long wait by a lady at the child development, however I think she must well have been... misinformed. Well we don't have a full statement right now, we're only just beginning the process. On education action and one set of IEP's in. The pre-school are doing OK so far and are experienced in getting statements quickly and smoothly which is great. I don't have any concerns regarding actually getting the statement (though would like it to hurry up) but rather whether I should push for a special school to be listed as the appropriate education, or stay mainstream. DS has another year and a bit before he is due to start school so I have time slightly on side, but I was unsure what to do. I think over the past few days I have come to realisation that I would prefer the special school however what I had been told (no places, would have to go so far away, wouldn't have a chance of getting into either if we were turned down by special etc etc) was putting me off a bit, well a lot. Perhaps that was their intention? Save HAVING to take another child on??? &#10;Thanks for the info, much appreciated, at least now I know I do have a leg to stand on."/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1195" language="en" documentId="4960" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Jen W(34)" date="03-04-10 21:56" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://www.netmums.com/coffeehouse/netmums-coffeehouse-archives-528/primary-school-admission-appeals-clinic-599/404307-special-educational-needs-re-mainstream-school-all.html" topic="mainstreaming" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="4960" notes="" title="Special Educational Needs re.
