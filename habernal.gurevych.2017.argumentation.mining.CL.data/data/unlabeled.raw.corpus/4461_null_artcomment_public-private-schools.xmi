Those schools over which state governments have full control (government schools) are largely (but not completely) funded by federal and state governments. Those over which state governments have more limited control, and parents greater, obtain a larger proportion of funding from parents and less from government. All non-government and many government schools have selective intake, and all schools can expel students (one of my secretaries had a son who would not be accepted by any government school after being expelled by two). Differences are of control rather than funding or access. &#10;Given that over 1.2 million students attend non-government schools, and that each non-government student place receives $6000 less total government funding than a government school place, transferring all these students to government systems at current funding levels would require an additional government expenditure of $7 billion a year (assuming some efficiencies). &#10;Alternatively we could run education like the health system, and require parents with high incomes to use non-government schools or pay a surcharge for the use of government schools - providing more funding for government school places just as it provides more funding for public hospital treatment. &#10;The fundamental flaw in your argument is that under no circumstances would ALL of the students transfer over. It's this weird blind side people have to the fact that even without government funding there will always be ~10% of kids in private schools, only at absolutely no cost to the government.
