I was not homeschooled, however, the majority of the kids my age at my church were. My mom was always very passionate about public schools because of the opportunities they can provide, especially for gifted or special needs children. When Virginia is a state that is consistently in the top 10 for their public education programs, and the city of Virginia Beach is consistently in the top 3 of best public education systems in the country, it completely blows my mind how so many families choose to deprive their children of these opportunities. While I knew some families who were great at homeschooling, I definitely knew the example family in this article - 12 children and 1 frazzled mother teaching the basics. Aside from structured education, children also need structured social lifes - with children other than their siblings, or other home school children they might work with at Chick Fil A or the local grocery store. I knew a family who sent one of their children to public school because he was special needs. He got more attention from the public school educators than his three siblings got from their mother. The arguments these parents provide as justification are ridiculous. The &quot;customized education&quot; is actually very prevalent in the Virginia public school system, as you do have the option of what science or math classes you can take. Not to mention all 13 high schools in the city of Virginia Beach have their own unique course studies from Technology and art, to medical and law studies. Not to mention the religious argument of if you are supposed to be a witness to &quot;non believers&quot;, how are you supposed to do that if you are never exposed to anyone with a different opinion from yourself? Homeschooling is only more and more toxic, and it makes me really fearful for the next generation of religious minded adults.
