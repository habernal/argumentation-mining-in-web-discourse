For some kids, public school is a good fit. For others, homeschooing, and so on. When my oldest started elementary school, we had 3 choices - public, private or homeschool. Now, it's really nice to see - 10 years later - that our district also offers an online academy, charter schools and hybrid-homeschool/public school options in which a student is homeschooled for part of the day then attends school for 1-2 subjects. Our district has some outstanding Spanish and Mandarin immersion charter schools in which most of the school day is taught in these languages. What a great skill to have in today's world - being bilingual. One of the Spanish immersion schools goes all the way through high school, so by the time a student is a junior in high school, the student has run out of Spanish classes to take in high school, so the student takes classes at a local community college, earning college credits in high school. Now that is a smart move both academically and financially! &#10;My kids did their elementary years in our local public school. However, as they've shown their interests, they are spreading their wings. My ODD is in a charter school that specializes in the arts. It is 30 miles from our house, but so worth the drive. My DS will start high school at a private Catholic school near our home. My YDD may attend this school or the local high school. We are still trying to figure out what will be the best fit for her. &#10;I think it's good idea to take a close look at a child's needs and the different schooling that is offered and go from there. But to answer your question, I do like homeschooling, especially when combined with a homeschooling club in which enrichment activities, the arts, etc. are done with other homeschooled kids.
