I believe that home schooling works for the bright (many of them have tutors and are from wealthy families) and very responsible students and parents, and because they will not waste the time that it is wasted in public schools for many reasons (multiple distractions that don’t have anything to do with academics).

I studied those subjects in high school in a Latin American country.
