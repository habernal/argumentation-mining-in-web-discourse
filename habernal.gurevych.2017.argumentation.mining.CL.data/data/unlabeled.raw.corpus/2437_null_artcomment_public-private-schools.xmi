Allison Benedikt also has the right to exercise this freedom.  It feels unfortunate she chooses to do so by placing criticism and judgment.  Why not write an article about how public schools move up, and or down, the ladder of excellence, and how we can make our local public school better.  What's up with the arrogance and judgment?   From the sounds of it, Allison feels immature to me and someone who has yet to become a Mother.  Her frame of reference for her argument though is certainly a nice outline for a debate team:  Public vs. Private Schools, in her framework, could also be swapped out with Levi's vs. Designer Jeans... Or Short vs. Long hair.  &quot;If more people would just invest in Levi's then Levi's could begin to offer nicer cuts to their blue jean line for a more affordable price.  Even if it makes your heiny look big... all the more reason to wear them... it's the law of large numbers.   Or... If more people would just wear their hair short, then it would be considered the good thing to do.  Long hair is bad.  And, if there are not enough styles or accoutrements you can wear in your hair when it's short..all the more reason to go short!  Then it can be YOU who maybe comes up with some better options for hair accessories.  And then YOU can be considered GOOD in my eyes.   Again.. Allison gets to have her freedom too even if she wants to use it calling some of us &quot;bad&quot; because we do what we feel is best for our families, our children, and our overall life goals and discipline we choose to instill into our children.  For me, I feel Allison is very Bad for judging people who don't do what she thinks is right.  The difference between me and Allison? Allison got paid to write her judgment.  I offered mine freely.
