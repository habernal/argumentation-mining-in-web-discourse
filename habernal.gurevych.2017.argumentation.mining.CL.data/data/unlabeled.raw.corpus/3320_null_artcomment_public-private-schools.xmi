I was almost raped by 10 Boys who grabbed Me in Public school when I was in the 5th grade. I fought hard and got away. but the trauma remains. When I told a Teacher She said I should not have been walking near the Boys restroom(it had an outside entrance) But on the scchool grounds it was impossible not to pass it.. So no help....They also attempted to hang Our Principle. FIinally I was sent to Private school and the relief was almost immediate... I Loved the Private School.  I had no more problems and was able to really learn. I started back to public school when I entered High school,kand because My education was better before that I skipped the 9th,10th band half of My Senior Year. I received awards for being more intelligent than the average Child... I grew up and did the same with my Children,Private school until High School and They also were known to be very intelligent. This all because We were given room and peace to learn and the attention to each student was better... So I disagree  Very much with the writer here. Public school will never be better than Private. Why? Because too many students and not enough educators...
