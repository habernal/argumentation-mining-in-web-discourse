I am Andrew Lawson's Mom....the one in video and on HBO. I realize that the end of the video on Boston.com made Andrew look like he was lost and depressed. My husband and I addressed that issue with the correspondent after the fact since we had no say on the outcome of the video! However, believe me when I say that Andrew is one happy guy and continues to be just as busy and happy after graduation as he was before. The videos can only capture a part of his life. They like to focus on particular aspects of his life. What they didn't mention is that for sports he also participates in Special Olympics. He has been on a SO swim team for 9 years, a SO ski team for 4 years and has recently joined a SO tennis team. My husband is past president and currently board member for both ARC of the South Shore and ARC of Massachusetts. I am on the Family Support Services board at the ARC of the South Shore and past member of the Norwell Parent Advisory Board. With that said, I just wanted to clarify that we didn't set Andrew up for a fall at the end of his high school years. We did not fail him or cause him any harm and yes we did prepare him for life after high school. No, he is not going to college...yet. He is however attending a vocational training program four days a week. He works at a local hospital 2 days a week as well as Old Navy and Hannaford Supermarket. On Friday's he works at Norwell High School with the Athletic Director. He is also assistant coach for both the boys varsity soccer and basketball teams at the high school which he enjoys very much. The Wednesday before Thanksgiving when the HBO video aired, Andrew had 30 of &quot;his guys&quot; and his basketball couch at our home to watch it together. So they are not all &quot;gone&quot; as Andrew had thought they might be. They are still coming back to hang out with him. After reading some of the posts I just wanted people to know and set the record straight that all is well with Andrew and he is doing just fine. He had such a wonderful experience all through the Norwell School system and we expect that he will continue on with a wonderful work experience or whatever he decides to do later on. We will continue to raise the bar and work on Andrew's behalf to give him the best working and living environment we can. I am a firm believer in inclusion. I also agree with other posters that it will always depend on the child. It will work for some and not for others but you should always at least try. Andrew was not a burden on his classmates. They were drawn to him. I thanked his classmates and the parents of his classmates for being SO supportive for many years. The response I received again and again was...&quot;no, thank you for allowing Andrew to be a part of their class!&quot; Many parents told me that they and their children got so much more in return. I can't argue that point! It was definitely well worth the effort and the best &quot;long term effect&quot; was what it did for Andrew's self confidence. He believes he is a very capable young man and so do I. So I will follow his lead and we will see where he goes....
