The first question to come up is what religion? Most people who favor the teaching of religion or religiously based mythology actually do not just favor teaching religion, they want their religion taught. Try suggesting that Islam should be given equal time and see what kind of a response you get. &#10;Not true. The inclusion of &quot;...under God...&quot; in the original godless pledge was religiously motivated. Most people who object to the pledge do so on the grounds that it is a government endorsement of religion. However, many years ago, even before the inclusion of &quot;under God&quot; in the pledge, the Supreme Court found that children could not be forced to salute the flag and say the pledge in public schools (West Virginia State Board of Education, etc., et al. v. Walter Barnette, et al., (319 US 624), 1943). The objections of the plaintiffs in W.Va. State BOE v. Barnette were religious. The decision still stands so that no student can be forced to recite the pledge. Of course, recent cases are about the question of whether the inclusion of &quot;under God&quot; is an endorsement of religion by the government, especially the school district. &#10;Sad to say, you are wrong. In recent years there have been several cases in my area where teachers were dismissed (after several warnings) for overt religious teaching - and it wasn't even science class. While it is fortunately rare that religion is overtly taught, it is still pretty pervasive in public schools. Does the choir at your school put on a Christmas concert? What kinds of songs does the choir sing? What do non-christian students in the choir do? In some schools, if they refuse to participate they get an F. What kinds of displays go up in the classrooms and in the halls? And, of course, there is the Pledge. &#10;Spoken like a true advocate of religion in the schools. If there had never been prayers and Bible reading in schools, if there had never been prayers before athletic events, if religiously based mythology had never been presented as science, then there wouldn't be any debate. The debate is not an effort to prevent you from practicing your religion. It is about efforts to get the forced practice of a certain minority religion out of our schools. This has been going on for years. The Supreme Court has said that there can be no more (public) Bible reading, no more classroom prayer, no more teaching of religious mythology as science. That you see this as irrelevant means two things: 1) progress is being made, 2) you aren't paying attention. &#10;You can carry your Bible if you want. You can even do it as a teacher. However, you should be warned that what you do with that Bible if you are a teacher might cause you some problems. After you dare the administration to do something about it you can feel proud of yourself in the unemployment line. Personally I find worship of an old book silly.
