Or will they be based on the NORMAL age for kindergartners, i.e. my kid’s age? I had better not be hearing about my child being behind or being immature, just because others decided to give their kids an unfair advantage.” EXACTLY what I am worried about. I further disdain the idea of “redshirting” because, just like its reference to sport, I have heard of many in my state using it so not only will their kid be academically ahead of his/her peers, but will also be physically bigger and stronger and therefore the “best” athlete in high school. &#10;My son has a May birthday, and we sent him on time. He is now in first grade. He had a great preschool and is a pretty calm kid so no behavior issues, so we felt he was ready. He is just below 50th percentile in height and weight, as are his Dad and me. So he’s one of the smallest in the class. Also, as of this month, he is the ONLY kid in his class who is still 6! A few of his classmates turned 7 in September/October!! At this age, those months can make a big difference! He is currently on or above level in all subject areas, but I still worry, especially when his teacher told me that they have raised reading level expectations by two levels, just since last year!! &#10;I have a summer birthday, and entered kindergarten normally back in the 70s. I was ALWAYS the smallest and youngest in my class (well, I passed up 2 or 3 people in height by middle school), but I was also at the top of my class academically. Of course, my son is learning things in first grade that I learned in third. Somehow, I still managed to get a graduate degree in a STEM field. So I’m optimistic things will be OK, I just want my kids to get strong foundations in reading and math and to like school and learning. I want them to be ready for the challenges of tough classes in middle and high school, which will have the most impact on their college and future success.
