The local school had very little resources, yet, it was free and open and all parents and students, including home schooled could come and go as they pleased, during the day or year, it was a rather transient community anyway. If a home schooled child wanted to spend one day a week or each day in one class they could do so. Sports programs at the local school were open to everyone, so that home schooled children were often part of the pe and music classes at the school, often taught by volunteers in the community. &#10;In this way a poor community manages education, I wouldn't recommend community based, volunteer education, you don't have choice, if a volunteer wants to teach bongos for three months. My poor children although they have been educated here, there and everywhere, they began their education in this way, literally never bought shoes for the youngest until she was five and are very relaxed but perplexed at times by the strict rules and conformity of formal education. Other than that, any way at all that we learn and progress is a good thing.
