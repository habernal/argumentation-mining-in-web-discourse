My pre-Ker actually had more than 30 minutes recess. &#10;The thing I strongly agree with is that every child progresses (or does not) individually. I want to add that it matters most what has been done or is being done at home. The variety of academic and creativity levels in a class of 17 is astounding! There is also good communication with the teacher and work (I guess you can call it homework) which can measure progress well. &#10;As far as being bored if ahead, I think it again really depends on how you supplement at home. There are gifted programs in the public system that start in first grade as well, that can add challenge and spark if needed. &#10;I have been very impressed with the teachers' ability to teach to all different skill levels and remember as much happening when I was in school. &#10;We need to remember how good it is for children to figure it out themselves, fit in the way they can, without too much manipulation from us. (I just thought of this because I was laughing at the thought that my mother never had a clue about my classes and never would have held me back or advanced me or manipulated the deal in anyway, for better or worse but it made me into a pretty savvy kid). There is so much good that comes from a little struggle. Sometimes, maybe the earlier, the better unless it's very hard emotionally.
