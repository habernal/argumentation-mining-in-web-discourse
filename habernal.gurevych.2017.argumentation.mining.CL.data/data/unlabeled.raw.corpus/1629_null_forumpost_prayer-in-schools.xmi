Having traveled to many nations throughout the world, and seeing and hearing about the ways religion affect a society, I think it is important to be thankful for the freedom of religion that we have here within the United States. Personally, I think that prayer in public schools should be completely allowed. I believe that regardless if you are Muslim, Christian, or any other religion, if people feel inclined or led to pray then great. I don’t think people should feel forced to participate in these, and that if they don’t want a part in it, than don’t participate. However, if prayer is going on and someone is opposing it, respect becomes a factor and people need to learn to respect others regardless if they agree or disagree with what is going on. Honestly, if there are non-religious people leading the prayers, then I don’t think the purpose of prayer is being walked out, and I think its hypocritical and gives a bad name to whichever religion is being exalted/demonstrated. However, I think denying students the freedom to express their spirituality is wrong and unconstitutional. I am not saying that everyone should have to partake in the prayer meetings, or moments of silent, but at least if there are these events happening, people, regardless of what religion, should respect the other people participating in religious activity. Offense is a choice a person takes, as a result of a contradicting feeling or opinion of someone else. It has to do with insecurity and pride. The question becomes do students in public schools today have enough respect for themselves? When they don’t respect themselves, how do we expect students to respect those around them? Prayer in school is freedom. Are we a country that allows its citizens to walk as freed people?
