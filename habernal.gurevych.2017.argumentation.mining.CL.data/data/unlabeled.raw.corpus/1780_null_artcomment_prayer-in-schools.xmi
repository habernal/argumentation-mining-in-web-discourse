I really hate that the Bible was taken out of public schools. I am a trong Christian and follower of Jesus Christ. I heard a true story about something about something like this. There was a girl with a condition where she would have random seizures that went to a public school. This school allowed a Satanist ‘religious’ group, but when some one asked about a Christian group for the Christians, they wouldn’t allow it. so one day this girl was in the school parking lot and waiting for her mom to get there to pick her up. But as her mom pulled up, this girl had a seizure. She had fell in the road before her mom had a chance to see her. her mom ended up hitting her with the car and she died on spot. the very next day as people pulled up at the school they noticed something going on at the spot where this girl was hit. it was the satanist group dancing around he spot where this girls blood was spilled and they were doing some type of ritual. my point with this story is people think its okay to be athiest, or be muslim, or satanist. in fact evolution is taught in schools. but yet we can as simple is pray before every class. or pray before lunch. how far does it have to go before christians do something about it?
