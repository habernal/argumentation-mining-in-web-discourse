The freedom of choice reflects the complexion of the long proud history of this country, and its right to say how well democracy has advanced it to the stature it holds today in the world. I personally do not know a single family that sends its children to a private school to show off, or seek prestige.  It is a common desire in this country to give children their best possible chance in life. I know families that have passed on buying and owning their home in order to send their kids to the best possible school they can. As for the religious slant the writer talks about; it is any parent’s right to worship in the manner they believe in. That is a big part of the reason the USA was started. Christian principles got this country and its people where it is today. Now a days there is such a struggle from non-Christians to force their views and even their life style on the children of this country, it makes me sick. The very things that made this country so desirable (just look at the stats of the people in the world who move here each year) are under threat from those who would enforce their ideology on the rest of us. If private schools are superior then many public schools by direct comparison, why would anyone be looked down on for trying to give their children the best possible start in life they can? The most popular show on cable TV right now is about a successful company started by a Christian man who over the years has had has whole family help build it into the success it is today. They make duck calls (a wind reed thing) and at the end of each show they show this family all sitting down together to share a meal. Before they eat they say a blessing, thanking God and asking him to watch over their children. My wife tells me that the producers of the show asked this family to stop praying before they ate their meal. It is refreshing to find out that they refused and would only agree to do the show if their profession of faith went on as it always has. I wish more people like them would stand up to the bullies who are bent on eradicating the very culture that made this country so prosperous. Yes, I am thankful the writer who decries parents the right to select any school they choose (so far) is not able to use force to get her way "/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2409" language="en" documentId="2512" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Bill (stns440)" date="Aug 29, 2013 9:06PM" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://living.msn.com/family-parenting/the-family-room-blog-post?post=ab228ffc-1e99-4b37-a7b8-0b6a4c3fb240" topic="public-private-schools" thumbsUp="6" thumbsDown="0" origId="2512" notes="" title="Is it wrong to send kids to private school?"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2409"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39"/></xmi:XMI>
