Oldest DD loves our neighborhood high school but youngest DD is already working towards the Early College high school which is on the other side of the county - which the county also provides transportation for - awesome! We were very blessed. Not a single one of these schools even existed when we bought our home. We bought here before we had our girls because the schools here were exemplary but we've been blessed that the ones closest to our home have drawn the best teachers and the best programs around as well as being newer facilities. Parental involvement - though not required - is very high. Community involvement is very high. &#10;For example - not everyone will know what this is - but as a reference point - every year - there is something called &quot;See You At the Pole&quot; (SYATP) which is an event that is theoretically held at any school internationally. It is the 4th Wednesday in September every year. It started the year *I* graduated from high school - so it's not a new occurrence. It is where Christian students gather at the flag poles of public schools to pray for their schools, teachers, students, administration. It is not sponsored by the school. It is not affiliated with the school in anyway. It does not take place during school hours. It occurs before school starts. My children attend this event. I attend with them. Locally, all of the pastors or youth pastors from every church in our town attend at a school of their choosing in our town. Especially if they have children in their church who attend a particular school. Parents come out to attend with their kids. Grandparents. Store owners. Local church members who don't even have kids. It's just one of those things. Not all students attend this of course. No one is pressured. Kids pull up to school and see what's happening and are respectful and walk right into school. No one interrupts or yells or acts like anything unusual is going on. When the bell rings - the event breaks up and kids go on in to class. Adults go on about their day. &#10;Sporting events draw out the town like you wouldn't believe. Small town. It's like Friday Night Lights or Dazed and Confused. Our town supports it's schools. &#10;Our school fundraisers are ridiculous. When the principal announced the total for fundraising last year - well let's just say it was more than some people make in a year. But it was parent and community input that did it. Parents KNOW each other. Parents know the kids. Parents turn up for events. We pack the house for chorus and band just like we do for football and basketball. &#10;It's not just the students and teachers that make the school. Parents and community go a long way towards how a school turns out.
