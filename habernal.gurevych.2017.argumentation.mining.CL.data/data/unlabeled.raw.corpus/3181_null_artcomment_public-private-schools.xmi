What an amazingly stupid story and reasons for sending your child to public school rather than a private school.  So here is why I send my children to private school rather than rely on the nimrods in the government school system.   1.  I want my children to learn that 2 + 2 = 4.  I do not care how they feel about the answer as is being taught in the public school system.  When they graduate, their employers do not care how they feel about their answer.  The employer wants them to get the answer right. 2.  Public schools are a glorified baby sitting service.  I want my children to be educated and not baby sat.  Public schools allow the students and the few parents who come trolling around to run the school and that affects how the teachers can teach.  I know this because I once taught in DeKalb County, GA.  You cannot throw out the student who is a constant problem in the classroom.  Hell you can barely discipline them.  Private schools do not put up with any crap.  Parents pay good money for their children to be taught and the teachers and administration take this notion seriously.  Teachers are not supposed to be substitute parents.  If you cannot control your child, then you have no place in a private school.   3.  Safety!  In my opinion, I feel that my child is safer at a private school than they would be at a public school.  This has more to do with parenting than it does with the actual school.  What is expected of a child at private school in how they act with their peers and with the teachers is far greater than what is generally expected of a child at a public school.  Again, this is because I witnessed it first hand teaching eighth graders at a public school in GA.    The argument about increased parental involvement would create a better school is an absolute joke.  When I taught back in 2003-2004 there were 1500 students in the three grades.  At the first PTA meeting only 150 parents showed up and these numbers went further down as the year progressed. Adding additional students with parents that might want to get involved will not make a dent.  Most of the parents do not care and only use the school as a place to dump their children during the day.  They only show up to defend their child when they have done something wrong.    Is parental involvement important? Absolutely!  The charter schools have it right in that it is a requirement that the parents be involved if their children are to attend.  The only children that go to charter schools are the ones who have parents that actually care about their child's education and know that it is the ticket to a better life.  The rest do not give a damn.  As long as parental participation in their children's education is voluntary, then nothing will happen.    Parent's need to support the teachers.  Stop believing that your child is perfect and can do no wrong.  Guess what?  YOUR CHILD IS NOT PERFECT AND NEVER WILL BE!  Public school teachers have a hard enough time controlling the class, they do not need the parent keeping them from controlling the class thinking that Johnny and Susy are  perfect and are not causing problems.   Ms Benedeikt is extremely shortsighted and obviously a bleeding heart liberal and believes that Johnny and Suzy should pass their grade regardless of whether they got the answers right or not as long as they felt good about the answer.
