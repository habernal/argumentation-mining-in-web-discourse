Always have, always will.  And I love it.&#10;Some public schools have really cool programs.  If I was homeschooled, there's no way I could take agriculture and work hands on with real live chickens and cows and goats.  I wouldn't be able to take welding, or pottery, or yearbook, or even some of the other less fancy classes, like psychology or Japanese.  My parents wouldn't be able to teach me Japanese because they don't know it.  Similarly, we don't have the tools to weld things or run our own mini-farm. &#10;I'm not saying that homeschoolers have poor social skills, and I understand that this is a really dumb stereotype, but you are exposed to much, much more interaction with many different types of people in public school.  Even getting stuck with that annoying jerk as a partner one day?  Yeah, that teaches you that people are jerks, you're going to have to work with them at one point, and so you learn how to deal with the jerks of the world.  Even getting teased can be beneficial, as I've also learned to deal with the mean kids and I think it's made me stronger.  (Though in more severe cases, I'm not against being homeschooled to avoid bullying.  My experiences were rather minor.)  Also, you're forced to get out of your comfort zone a little.  See, I'm in Yearbook, and we have to talk to people that we don't know on almost a daily basis.  At first I was really uncomfortable (I'm an introvert), but now it's gotten to the point where I can march right up to a total stranger and introduce myself. &#10;A few people on here have talked about drugs, sex, and alcohol.  I'm not going to lie and say that high school is a sunny place filled with unicorns and rainbows, but you can make your own choices.  As soon as you walk through the front gates, drugs aren't going to drop right into your lap.  You have to look for trouble in order for it to find you.  I live in a pretty urban area, and never once have I been pressured into doing drugs, simply because I have a lovely group of friends who share the same morals as I do. &#10;And the teachers.  Oh, the teachers!  Over the course of high school, I've had maybe two teachers that I didn't really like.  None have seemed apathetic or uncaring towards the students.  I've met some teachers that I now consider to be friends, and I regularly talk to them about things I'd never even think of bringing up to my parents.  I'm so, so blessed for the people who've been introduced into my life via public school. &#10;You guessed it: I'm strongly in favor of public school for the average teenager.  I know that everyone's situation is different: some schools might be underfunded, filled with teachers that don't teach, bullies, and bad influences.  Some kids might have learning disabilities or other special circumstances that prevent them from fitting well in a traditional high school setting.  But for the most part, I think high school has made me a better person :) &#10;&#10;"/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="3033" language="en" documentId="441" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="PikaChica" date="October 28, 2013 17:37" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://nanowrimo.org/forums/age-group-teens/threads/128227?page=6" topic="homeschooling" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="441" notes="" title="Homeschooling - debate"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="61"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="62" end="148"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="149" end="614"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="615" end="1622"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="1623" end="2144"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="2145" end="2574"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="63" sofa="1" begin="2575" end="3031"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="3032" end="3032"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="71" sofa="1" begin="3033" end="3033"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59 63 67 71"/></xmi:XMI>
