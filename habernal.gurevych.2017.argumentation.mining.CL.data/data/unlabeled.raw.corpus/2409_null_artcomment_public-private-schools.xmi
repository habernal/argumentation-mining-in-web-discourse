I am a private school student, but my situation is a bit different than that Ms. Benedikt describes. My family cannot afford the school I attend, but instead I am on 90% financial aid. I pay for a remaining 5%, and my parents cover the other. Am I, therefore, a bad person for sending myself to private school? I was the one who chose to go, and while I think the barbell idea is interesting, I also don't think it pertains. The public high school/middle school I attended for 3 years was exceptional...for people of average or below-average intelligence. Though I hate to sound conceited, I consider myself of above average intelligence. Ms. Benedikt makes the argument that parents should rally to make the public schools better, and mine certainly did, though I did as well. In 9th grade, my algebra teacher refused to teach harder material and would not allow me to move to a harder class, even though I knew the nearly the entirety of the material, as did others in the class. Halfway through the school year, my English teacher asked me to grade my classes' papers for her. My band director refused to let me play the bassoon that I had worked long hours to be able to rent, and though he relented half-way through the year, when I asked the school board for help renting, they instead bought the school a gong for a single song. It has not since been used.   I understand that Ms. Benedikt is adamant in her belief that parents need to send their children to public school to make those schools better, but I hope she will understand that a handful of smarter students cannot make an entire system better. Furthermore, perhaps by sending the more intelligent children to private school, the public school system would be able to cater to the average level, instead of straining to help those of higher, which would skew the system to meet the needs of average kids. In the future, perhaps she will be able to see the other side of an argument and consider the possibilities that await either party before penning such a controversial article.  -An 11th grader "/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2122" language="en" documentId="2409" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Matilda Hendrickson" date="Aug 30, 2013 12:42PM" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://living.msn.com/family-parenting/the-family-room-blog-post?post=ab228ffc-1e99-4b37-a7b8-0b6a4c3fb240" topic="public-private-schools" thumbsUp="14" thumbsDown="0" origId="2409" notes="" title="Is it wrong to send kids to private school?"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2122"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39"/></xmi:XMI>
