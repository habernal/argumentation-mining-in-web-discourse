We did our civic duty and enrolled our older kids in public school. We now home school our younger ones, and it has been an enjoyable and rewarding experience for our family. I'll look out for my own kids, thanks. Nobody else has a greater stake in their success than we, their parents, do. Why should we sacrifice them on the alter of the greater social good? They are our responsibility, because we brought them into this world.  Your argument that if more people sent their kids to public school, there would be more involvement and support for public schools, doesn't necessarily stand. Our family has been involved in cooperative preschools where a handful of parents did the bulk of the work. In the volunteer organizations I have belonged to, only a small core of dedicated people turns out for fundraisers and events - we are chronically shorthanded and overworked. I would expect the same of volunteerism and fundraising in most schools. A few schools might shine, but I would expect that to be the exception rather than the rule. I know several public school teachers and administrators whose children attend private schools. If the people who are most closely connected with public schools aren't willing to invest in them, why should our family? I have, and continue to, volunteer my services in tutoring other people's kids free of charge, because I do believe that it is good to mentor students who want to learn and who may not have parental support. We also pay property taxes, while receiving no direct personal benefit - and we get no tax break for our home schooling expenses.  Strong families are needed to &quot;fix&quot; the school system. Unless there is a great social shift back toward committed two-parent families, personal accountability, and self sufficiency, there is NO school reform that will make an iota of difference.
