They are regularly attacked in the press, misrepresented in drama. misunderstood and held in suspicion by much of the general public and used in the most disgusting way as a scapegoat repeatedly by those involved in child protection to try and pass the buck. &#10;Since January 2009 many of us have been spending hours learning about the parliamentary process, the Freedom of Information Act, eduction law and many many other things in order to protect our ability to provide an education suitable to our children's needs. I was even to some extent happy that I broke both my legs last summer and was confined to bed for 3 months as It meant I could spend more time defending our precious freedoms! &#10;The national curriculum is a one size fits all education that is failing anyone who isn't 'average' and with it's tests and targets imposing dangerous levels of stress on both staff and pupils. It is the reason some choose to home educate from the start and many are forced out of the system in order to protect their children's education and mental health. &#10;And parental will is far from the only deciding factor in most home educated children's lives, on the whole they have at least an equal voice. What about school educated children, do they all have a voice in where and how they are educated. The only genuine time parents do not decide is where they have no choice of school or are refused the one they want and no one would consider that beneficial.
