Ms. Benedikt was the film editor for the Village Voice, and has been a writer and editor at the Chicago Tribune and Brill’s Content. She graduated from the University of Michigan. SUCH A RETARD Allison sent her kids to a Private Preschool, She Brags about being rich and living in the most expensive city in the world. But she can now buy a bigger house because she is sending her kids to public schools.  This story is all about Allison buying her house and living in the most expensive city in the world of the gift of tax payers and public schools . ALLISON Not all of that $5K will go toward a family home — to pay for preschool, we stopped contributing to our 401k years ago. So 2018 will also be the year we start paying into it again — not that we will ever be able to retire — and, hey, let’s put some away for college, shall we? Yes, we are, by the standards of most Americans, rich. My husband and I both have steady jobs, make good salaries and are lucky enough to live in one of the most expensive cities in the world simply because we want to. As Gawker’s Hamilton Nolan wrote earlier this year, we can’t cry poor just because we don’t have a lot of money left after we’ve spent it all.   Allison you are a CLASS A RETARD!   We would love to send our kids to Public Schools However-The School is too dangerous and the teachers SUCK! The Parents who send their criminal children to the public schools  infect the good children and the good parents. The reason why schools are failing is because of the Parents. You  are a RETARD to think you can change the RETARD Parents.   Allison-What you really want to say- is Lets make  all the kids DUMB. LETS MAKE IT FAIR FOR THE DUMB KIDS AND PARENTS WHO COULD CARE LESS. What you are also saying is that white people have an advantage with education and black people could never compete with a white private school.  BLAME YOURSELF AND DEMORATS!! You are the Reason why Detroit is gone! University of Michigan SUCKS! You need to get a refund for you education, you did not learn anything.
