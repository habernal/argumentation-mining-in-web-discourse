My wife and I homeschooled our 3 eldest kids for 4 years then we sent them to Public School which was a big mistake our kids began to fall behind in many subjects, this year we are going to Home School again and this time we are going to have 1 in High school a sophomore, 1 in 8th, 1 in 6th, 1 in 2nd and 1 in Kindergarten our youngest is 1 so we have awhile before she is taught anything other then having fun. We choose to Home School mainly because we do not agree with what is taught in CA public schools, we are against Homosexuality being taught as an acceptable way of life when the Bible clearly states that it is a sin and an abomination, we are also against the Liberal indoctrination that goes on in the schools nowadays. I teach History Science and Life Skills my wife teaches Math and English Arts. When we first sent our kids to public school the Principal came to me and said that my wife and I did an amazing job homeschooling our kids as they were all further along then all of the other kids in the school. My second eldest son who is 13 now scored perfect scores on his state testing 3 years in a row and at 13 is doing calculous. My 2 eldest are going to be going to an independent study school and the local Community College as well as being taught at home. It is sad though that there are people out there that think the only education our kids should get are from a Public school indoctrination center. Our kids get the social skills they need through their friends and church youth groups as well as Football and cheerleading. You don't have to go to a public school to learn social skills there are many places to learn that skill set. In closing I feel it is the Parents not the Governments job to educate their kids how they see fit period....
