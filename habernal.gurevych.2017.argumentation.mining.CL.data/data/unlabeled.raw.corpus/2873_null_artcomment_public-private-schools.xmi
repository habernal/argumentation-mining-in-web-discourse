Bring my child down to save yours? If there aren’t enough kids in public schools to make them “better” than a few thousand more won’t make a difference! I understand that we don’t want to leave any children behind and everyone should own a house and blah bah blah. But the reality is some children have the misfortune of being born to **** parents and some children have the misfortune of being born poor and some of us will be left behind  … and some of us will succeed and some of us will own a home and some of us will become quite successful…by working hard. This is the reality of LIFE. If your school is crappy you need to go to all the meetings and sit on the front steps of city hall until someone listens… I grew up poor and went to a “crappy” public school but guess what, I am an intelligent, successful person. Since when is it up to the most affluent of us to make sure that we take care of ourselves? Since when should someone that works hard to get their lives to the point where they can afford private school for their children be responsible for a neighborhood that obviously does not care? Hold your own school accountable! Why don’t all of us “poor” people just lie down and let the rich folks tell us what to do, when to do it and how to do it. There is no such thing as personal responsibility anymore…… "/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1372" language="en" documentId="2873" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="exliberal62" date="Aug 29, 2013 8:06PM" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://living.msn.com/family-parenting/the-family-room-blog-post?post=ab228ffc-1e99-4b37-a7b8-0b6a4c3fb240" topic="public-private-schools" thumbsUp="17" thumbsDown="0" origId="2873" notes="" title="Is it wrong to send kids to private school?"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1372"/><types:PersuasivenessAnnotationMetaData xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" annotator="annotator1" isPersuasive="true" labelDetailed="P1" isGold="false" comment="Its not really clear at the beginning of the post what the writer is up to but then they state that they went to public school and still intelligent and they say people shouldnt give up on having better public schools but go to city halls and ask for it, so i think its persuasive and shes for public schooling" annotationBatchName="firstTraining" conflictResolvingAnnotation="false"/><types:PersuasivenessAnnotationMetaData xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" annotator="annotator2" isPersuasive="true" labelDetailed="P1" isGold="false" comment="She does not explicitly claims anything against or for the private schools but sure does share her personal experience that she had at a public school and still turned out to be a successful person." annotationBatchName="firstTraining" conflictResolvingAnnotation="false"/><types:PersuasivenessAnnotationMetaData xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" annotator="annotator3" isPersuasive="true" labelDetailed="P1" isGold="false" comment="for public schools, personal story, appeal on emotions (some people are poor, bad parents, etc.)" annotationBatchName="firstTraining" conflictResolvingAnnotation="false"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 55 67"/></xmi:XMI>
