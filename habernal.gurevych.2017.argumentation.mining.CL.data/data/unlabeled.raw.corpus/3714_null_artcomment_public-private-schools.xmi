A couple hundred years ago, we didn't even have a public school system. People from that time in history could write, speak and figure better than most of us can now. As our society gets &quot;dummed&quot; down, and humanism starts to take over (those like the author who only want the power and control to &quot;own&quot; OUR children, and speak their own agenda into their hearts), there is only room for those in authority to tell us what we should be thinking. We need to watch where we are headed as a country! I am all for private and homeschooled education. If public school works for your family, that is wonderful! I do not presume to make YOUR choice for you. I would like to make mine! Santo Nino, how can having God's love and peace &quot;crammed down their throats&quot; be any worse than my child being forced to hear about sex, its deviations, humanism, and evolution without any choice of having a say in it? Our children learn about their moral compass from their parents. Unfortunately, the United States is losing her moral compass, and is going to see herself in a very bad place if we allow it to continue.  If we truly love the freedoms we have in America, we had better start doing it differently. What we are doing is NOT working. I promise to do my part in this little part of my world.  May God redeem and bless America!!!
