If that's out of the question, how about getting in touch with the local clerics and arranging someone to meet the children at the school, escorting them to the temple, ministering the service and then bringing them back to the school? If the community leaders and parents were truely worried about their children attending prayer then this would be an easy solution to get everyone to agree with and get implemented. &#10;letting the service be performed in the school, during school hours, is not right. It's a distraction to everyone at the school, creates an atmosphere for hazing and bullying by highlighting a significant difference between students and by showing one group preferance. It opens the door for all other groups to step forward and say &quot;you did it for them now you HAVE to do it for us&quot; and the school board has no leg to stand on to say no. &#10;Now there is a situation where if they stop the service at the school then the Musslims will feel offended and will get upset and protest, OR if they let the service continue but say NO to the next group that asks for the same treatment then they showing bias and placing one group before another. &#10;These are just some of the reasons why services cannot be allowed in PUBLIC SCHOOLS. I put that in caps because some of the posters and replyers seem to be rolling all schools into the same catagory but all there are special religion based schools that the kids could attend.
