But I don't see how, I would love to see this research becuase I am honestly curious. &#10;The way I see it is that as a culture in the US we are pushing our kids more and more at a younger age to do more. When I called my school department and asked about holding dd back due to her just being young I was told that she had to go to kindergarten at five. If I chose to hold her out when I registerd her at 6 she would go to first grade. Now this is just my school district. I questioned them, stating that her preK teacher felt she might not be ready for the requirements of kindergarten. I was told she would be given &quot;extra help&quot; if she needed it. But my question is why do I set up my child up for the possibility of needing extra help for the next 12 years when simply giving dd an extra year of preK could solve the problem? She would be ready for the requirements, and might even excel at her learning becuase she had an extra year to mature. I don't see how this would harm her in the long run. &#10;Dh did an extra year of school between kinder and first. His district had a thing called readiness. So he graduated just before he turned 19. He was not harmed in going to school for one extra year. &#10;My brother excels academically when he puts in the effort. He was a young kindergartener. My parents wanted to hold him back that year but his teachers said he was too smart academically. I am not saying holding him back would have solved all of the problesms but he always was friends with kids a year or so younger than him. He started having difficulty in middle school becuase he just didn't put the effort in. My parents worked with him. He was smart and could do the schoolwork without issue. But he didn't want to. He dropped out at 17, in his senior year when he learned he wasn't going to graduate. A year later he got his GED. He is just now, at 30, graduation from college. He making deans list at his college. Holding him back a year may not have solved anything, but pushing him ahead certainly did not do him any good in the long run. &#10;I think it needs to be taken on a case by case basis. But with the new requirements on kids for academics I think redshirting them can be a very good idea. It gives them more time to have fun and just be kids before they are expected to be in a room for 6 hours a day learning. Recess is being cut back, testing is very important and kids spend hours practicing for the tests and getting ready for them (at least in my state). So I think if you wnat to give your child an extra year at the beginning to have fun and relax, well it can't hurt them.
