Guess what the teachers complained about the amount of children in the class, they expected 5-6yr olds just starting K to watch all the other kids before school get to play but because they didn't have the staff nor would they let parents(I asked if I could) supervise their area, they were forced to stand and wait.  I did bring this up and the problem with public schools, ITS PUBLIC SCHOOL!!! Teachers are not accountable, funding go's elsewhere, the schools are over crowded.  Yes a parent can rise up and make a stand against a crappy public school, take their child like I did and enroll them in a private academy where parents do hold the staff responsible since you're paying for them.  The teacher's don't have a union to hide behind, they are accountable for their actions and teaching.  I am by no means rich, but I am responsible for raising my child and if I think the public school isn't the best for my child, guess what I'm not going to send him there.  I wonder if the woman that wrote the story even has kids....I would guess not as it seems the ones that think they know best know nothing.  So quick recap, I believe parents sending their children to private school is their way of showing the public school that it has to change and become move competitive.  If not attendance will continue to fall and the public school system will fail.  Let us all hope that the public schools will start to do what is needed for the children instead of what is best for the union and their pensions.
