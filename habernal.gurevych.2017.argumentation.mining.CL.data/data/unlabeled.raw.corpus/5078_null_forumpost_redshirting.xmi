For one, if the child is not socially ready for school it will catch up with them. It is happening to my dd right now. LAst year we were told she might not be ready for kindergarten. We looked into holding her back, it was for social reasons only- she is just young and had trouble paying attention to things. Our city told us that we cna't hold her out, if she is five she has to go to kindergarten. Even more, if we held her out and went to register her when she was 6 they would put her in 1st grade. STupid rules. So we enrolled her in kindergarten. Here it is April and she is having trouble with the same things. Academically she is fine WHEN she pays attention. But if she isn't paying attention (daydreaming, etc) she misses things. That makes it harder for her to keep up. And then next year in first grade they are expected to be even more independent. &#10;For some kids entering kindergarten at 5, or younger, can be great. But kindergarten today is like first grade was 5 years ago. They are coming out able to write and read. Some kids do great with this, others just are not developmentally ready. And if you put your kid in and they aren't developmentally ready, at some point it most likely will catch up with them. And honestly I would much rather hold my kid back in preK then in first or second grade. In preK at least she can have another year of fun, rather than another year of sitting in her seat half of the day doing work. &#10;We are considering holding our ods out of kindergarten for an extra year. This time I will be fighting my city on it after waht happened to my dd. Yds is a June baby and we may do the same thing. The new lo is going to be a July baby- chances are high we will hold him out an extra year as well. Academically they could be ready, but I would rather have to work to challenge my kid than work to push them to do something they are just not developmentally ready for.
