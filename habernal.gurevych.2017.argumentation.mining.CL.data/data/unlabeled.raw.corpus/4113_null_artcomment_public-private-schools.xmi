It has nothing to do with the &quot;rich&quot;  They have always sent their children to private school. The issue is the middle class.  Fifty year ago they always sent their kids to public schools.  Then schools started to go into the &quot;crapper&quot; (while they still had their kids in school) so when it finally got so bad that they couldn't stand it anymore they took their kids out and put them into private schools.  They did this even though it significantly effects their standard of living.  I am a case in point.  Two daughters one year apart.  One went to public high school and the other went to private high school (after a disastrous freshman year).  The younger one was overwhelmed by all the drugs and violence at the school (a girl was shot and killed after a football game and this is not in the ghetto, it is in an upper middle class neighborhood).  My daughters repeatedly told us that kids show no respect for teachers, disrupt the classrooms and constantly smoke dope.  They say that the smell in the halls is so strong that the teachers have to be chocking on it.  That freshmen year I was constantly complaining to teachers, counselors and the principle.  Rhetoric and no action.  Some teachers finally told us in private that we needed to get then hell out of their if we want our daughter to make it thru high School.  Fortunately my older daughter was more able to ignore and block out the distractions and not be influenced by it all.
