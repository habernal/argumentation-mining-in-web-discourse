He has a BA from a good university. Here's what most of the posters are missing. First, if the parents are incompetent to teach basic school subjects, doesn't that mean the &quot;qualified&quot; teachers failed to teach that parent properly? If the student was well-educated in the public school, he should know the material well enough to teach it. &#10;Secondly, real education is self-taught. If you learn only what another person shoves into your head, you are not educated. Truly educated people know how to teach themselves. That was my goal. I taught my children what I knew. We learned other things together. The remainder they taught themselves using books, mentors, and other resources. They were the only students in their college classes who actually knew how to learn. The others only knew how to memorize and regurgitate. &#10;While there may be a very small number of homeschooled children who finish school poorly educated, there are far more graduating from public school without an education. Should we really force children to be supervised by people who have not yet figured out how to educate the students they are already responsible for? When California tried to forcibly end homeschooling, 30 percent of the children our district could read, write, or calculate at grade level. 100 percent of my students, as tested by the school, were at a post-college level in all subjects but math by fifth grade, and two grade levels in math. So, who was the better educator? Doing it their way would have netted their results. My results were better because I was a better teacher.
