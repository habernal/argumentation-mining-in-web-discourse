I've done A LOT of research on this subject. Everyone I have talked to in the educational system and various health care professionals like pediatricians and child psychologists say that if you have any doubt to hold your child back. You want school to be a positive experience for your child and if they are struggling academically, emotionally or socially giving them more time to mature before they start will only work in their favor. &#10;One of the most convincing people I spoke to in my research was a Kindergarten teacher that retired last year after 50 years of teaching K. I spoke to her many times for a long time about this and felt comfortable in our decision after hearing her experience with this. &#10;She said that she has never, ever had a parent come back to her and say to her that she wishes they hadn't held a child back but she has lost count on how many parents said they wish they had waited, pulled their child out to wait another year or have them repeat K. &#10;Basically there are no disadvantages to waiting if you feel your child needs to for whatever reason. &#10;People make such a big deal about the older kids but quite honestly I volunteer at my DD's school all the time. I work in the library and tutor so I have really gotten to know the kids. You can almost never tell who the older or younger kids are in a class. Of course there are some that are taller and shorter than others but you know what? I started school when I was 4 and I'm 5'10&quot;...so growing up I was one of the youngest ones but was taller than everyone so that means nothing. The kids all get along well together. Some are at the older end, some are at the younger end and the rest are all spread out in the middle. I'm not sure why it bothers people that a 5 and 6 yr old are in class together?&quot; &#10;Thank you! I will never understand why people feel the need to be so opposed on waiting a year when a child has a summer birthday-namely Aug or Sept. &#10;I did what I felt was best for our kid and her own personal scenario. We were getting ready to have a sibling for her and she was not going to be the only child anymore, which she was for 5 yrs and had a little bit of a difficult time adjusting. I felt she was fine academically, but not socially or attention, listening, sitting still, etc. Her birthday is Aug 22nd. She would have entered K at age 4. She made the cut off by a week. We decided to wait, and she went the following year, actually on her 6th birthday. Her class is 5 and 6 yr olds. No regrets.
