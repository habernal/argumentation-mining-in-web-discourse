Except for a few faculty children who were girls, Eaglebrook is a 95% plus all male Middle School. We were academically advised by Dr. Elizabeth MacNaughton when our children were born to consider a Middle School boarding experience for our children in a single sex school since Middle School is when boys go through puberty. The thinking was that Boys had an easier time transitioning through puberty in an all boys environment. Moreover, there was less distraction during academic classes from girls experiencing their own transition through puberty. I strongly believe that my boys benefited greatly from Eaglebrook, which is a fine academic institution. I also believe that they benefited greatly from the single sex environment during middle school. My boys matriculated to co-educational secondary schools, Deerfield Academy and The Hill School. I also strongly believe that their social skills with the opposite sex developed greatly as a result of a coeducational secondary school experience. &#10;I advise friends who are open-minded to consider a single sex school for middle school. Middle School can determine who becomes the academic achievers. I would not trade our Eaglebrook Experience for admission to Harvard. Again, since my boys were distraction they were able to learn the fundamentals of algebra and other learning skills required to be a success in life. Thank you.
