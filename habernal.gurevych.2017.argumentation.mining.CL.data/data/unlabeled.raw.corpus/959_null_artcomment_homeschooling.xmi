I always had the impression that it was for people who didn't want their precious little darlings to mix with the local oiks or see anyone outside their immediate circle as somehow threatening (which I admit may be mere prejudice on my part). I do, however, believe children should be exposed to influences and knowledge other than their parents' , and any kid worth his or her salt will want to get away from them on occasion and have some kind of non-parental-controlled life outside the family, especially as they get older. &#10;Having said that, I have one friend who's temporarily (and reluctantly) going to home-educate her 10-year-old, because, unlike her other children who are doing fine at school, he's deeply unhappy, and moving him to another school apparently wouldn't solve the problem. Of course she should have the right to do so and is in the best position to make this judgement. &#10;What I don't understand, though, is why Wynne is making such a fuss about having to register. What's the problem with this? Society has a responsiblity towards children, not just parents. Education authorities have a duty to make sure children are actually getting educated. If Wynne is confident her child is healthy and happy and getting a good education at home, why should she object in to registering in any way? Why should she object to her child being interviewed? I'm actually quite surprised that 'home educators' don't already have to do this. &#10;Someone on this thread (sorry, can't remember who) gave the excellent example about young girls being withdrawn from school to be 'home educated' only then to be groomed and shipped off into forced marriages. Not all parents act in their children's best interests and some are actively abusive. Parents don't own their children and fortunately this is recognised in law. School teachers can often be the only trusted adults a child can turn to if the family is the root of the problem, and for some children school can be a safe haven. If access to other trusted adults is taken away from them, then surely the occasional check-up to make sure all is well with the child, not the parent, is to be welcomed.
