In my case, this mean that, in the areas I excelled (reading, literature), I was able to advance and a very fast pace. It also meant that the areas I found challenging and difficult (mathematics), I was able to receive personal attention which addressed the specific areas I was struggling. It turned me from being a middling-to-below-average math student who hated to do the work to a person who decided to major in mathematics once I went to university. Additionally, my mother only chose to homeschool me (and later my brothers) when she studied the middle-school curriculum - finding it totally inadequate. &#10;Well I certainly wasn't homeschooled so I could develop independent thought But, frankly, as someone who has known lots of homeschoolers, I've got to say that one of it's greatest weaknesses is its tendency to produce spoiled people who have never once had to compromise their actions or thoughts for the sake of the group. If you've spent your whole life being able to do your school work in bed, you are going to struggle when you have to stand in line at the post-office. &#10;Well all right then - since you have already decided what homeschooling is about, I guess there is no point in discussing the issue. &#10;That said, I totally support strong checks and balances on homeschooling. By choosing to homeschool, a parent is, in effect, promising the rest of society that they are going to produce a supportive, useful, healthy new citizen - society has the right to make sure that the parent is fulfilling his or her promise.
