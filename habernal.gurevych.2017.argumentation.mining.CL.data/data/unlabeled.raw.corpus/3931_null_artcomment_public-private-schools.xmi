I grew up in a public school and did well.  Back then the teachers had teeth to punish and expel those that did not behave, and they used that power.  If you didn't do the work, you failed and more than likely, your dad whipped you when you got home.   Now the teachers are bullied by the students, cannot punish a student, are coerced into passing students or changing grading curves so that everyone passes.  Parents sue if their kid is cut from or does not play on a sports team.  When parents are called to help with a failing student, they curse and complain to the principal or simply hang up the phone. I visited a local school and saw 1st and second graders sleeping in class.  I was told that the parents did not make their kids go to bed and told the teachers to mind their own business.   I sent my daughter to a small private school.  They challenged her academically and personally and I did not have to worry about fights, gangs, drugs, etc..  The other parents were always involved and concerned about their kids and backed the administration if a issue arose.   I wish the public schools still had the teeth and ability to teach our kids.  They have the desire, but thanks to various rights groups, do not punish theories and everyone afraid to stand up to the whiners, their hands are tied.  It would have saved me $200k.
