One has a science degrees, and the other an engineering degree and an MSc. (Just to set the scene) &#10;Firstly, &quot;schooling&quot; is a complete misnomer. Real education begins when schooling stops. We did NOTHING formal until age 13, except reading, writing and arithmetic. My son got a grade A in GCSE physics in 9 months from a standing start, because he came fresh to the subject, and because they were inquisitive about the world. Education is what's left when what has been schooled has been forgotten. &#10;Addressing the quote above, this is nonsense we have heard since we started home educating all those years ago. I can inform you, without fear of contradiction, that their social development is far superior to children in school. School children's peers comprise their own school year solely, probably only their class. They look UP to the years above them, they look DOWN on the years below them. Home educated children, in contrast, happily relate to all ages from senior citizens to toddlers. When, at age 15, a small group of HE children went to college for further GCSEs, the lecturer remarked, without knowing their background, how these 3 HE girls could chat happily to everyone, including the adults in the class, whereas the schoolchildren in the class doing GCSE repeats could only talk amongst themselves. &#10;....and of course they missed out on that vital part of school life - being bullied. In one amusing incident we watched as a schoolboy tried to bully my son. It failed completely because my son was unaware that he was being bullied, and ignored it.
