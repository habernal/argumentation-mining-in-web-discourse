To begin with the writer makes the assumption that &quot;bad people&quot; send their kids to private schools.  She lists family tradition, religion, and prestige as less compelling reasons for sending your children to private schools.  Let me address those reasons in order.  First, sending your children to a school because there is a long-standing family tradition is no more illogical than parents hoping to have their children attend their college alma matter.  Second, religion plays a prominent roll in many families, including mine.  As such, parents want their children to receive an education that includes their strongly held religious beliefs.  For me, this was the primary reason for sending my children to Catholic schools, in the grand scheme of things the moral strength of my children is paramount, more so than even their academic success. Finally, why do some collegiate students decide to attend Ivy League Schools when they could simply attend their local state school?   They choose to attend these schools because successful graduation from a prestigious school will likely aid them in obtaining a well paying and successful career.  In the same way, attending a school with a reputation for academic rigor will likely allow graduates to attend colleges that have prestigious academic reputations.  Benedikt's argument is foolish on its face value.  In the 1970's when American automobiles had a reputation for being poorly built and designed, should Americans have flocked to their local Ford or GM dealer to buy American cars in an effort to get American cars to improve their performance?  Of course not, what they did was buy Japanese and German cars and their competition forced American car manufacturers to respond by making better cars.  The best way to improve public schools, schools in which I teach, is to have competition from private schools and that competition will force the public schools to respond with changes that will make them more competitive.  Why is the University of California-Berkeley such a good school?  Because an even better Stanford University is located across the bay!
