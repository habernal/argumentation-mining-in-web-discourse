Most private school students do not come from so-called &quot;wealthy&quot; families, and not all public schools &quot;stink&quot;. My child attends private school and we are under the median income for our area and nowhere near wealthy- we're actually lower middle class, and most of the families at our school are at a similar socio-economic level, with many lower on the income ladder than we are. We all make major sacrifices -shop at thrift stores, have vehicles over 10 years old, etc.- to send our children to private school because we have no control over the schools in our area. Tax dollars that should be earmarked for schools are being spent elsewhere by the state we live in, and we have no say in the matter. Teachers at our local public school -where we were originally planning to send our child- were found to be cheating on state tests. Not a place I'm going to send my 5-year-old. We tried to transfer him into the one public school in our district that has full-day kinder and offers great teachers- it was full and we were waitlisted. That's why we opted for private school. My kindergartener is now getting a full-day second grade education (they teach at least one and often two levels above that of public schools) along with Spanish, music, and science teachers that come to his class daily. The partial day Kindergarten at our local school (the one our boundaries require us to attend) can't even begin to compare. If I want to sacrifice a new car, a new home, and an updated wardrobe so that my kid can get the type of educational environment he needs, why shouldn't I be able to without some writer getting on her high-horse and telling me I'm wrong for doing it? I'll take a guess that she drives a new car, has an amazing wardrobe and all the shoes she can wear, plus a house that isn't 60 years old like mine. Maybe if she stuck her money where her mouth is, her children would get a better education as well. My property taxes still pay the county and state for public education. I'm just not personally using it.
