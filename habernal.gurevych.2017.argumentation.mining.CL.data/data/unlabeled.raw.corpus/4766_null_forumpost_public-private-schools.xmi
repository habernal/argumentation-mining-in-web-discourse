Iyt remained the dominate purpose of public education until 1958, when the National Defense Education Act, replaced our liberal education with education for technology for military and industrial purpose. It is vitally important we return to the original purpose of public education as soon as possible, because we stand to loose our liberty and freedom if we do not. I will provide all the information about this you may want. &#10;The result of education for a technological society with unknown values, is social chaos and skyrocketing social problems, as will taking major steps towards a police state. We know think Christians have the only legitimate claim on God and morality, and this is a terrible distortion of what democracy is all about. Democracy comes from philosophy, not religion, and requires a population trained for critical thinking. Only when the masses are trained for critical thinking, is a highly moral society possible, and only highly moral people can have liberty. &#10;In short, unless democracy is defended in the classroom, it is not defended.&#10;We have taken the same path Germany took to the New World Order, and are what we defended our democracy against. Unless we immediately realize this and what education has to be with manifesting a democracy with liberty, we have fought every war for nothing. It use to take over a year to mobilize for war, and we paid for those wars by selling war bonds, with schools being essential to mobilizing us for war and selling war bonds. Now we can engage in a war in 4 hours and do more damage than could be done in several months of fighting. Our national defense no longer depends on patriotic citizens, but citizens who programmed dromes for industry, paying taxes to support an extremely exspenive high tech military that is no longer about national defensive as we understood it, but New World Order style is about defending our economic interest around the world. &#10;The folks saying we no longer need publically support public education, do not understand why nations educated the masses. They really do not understand what education for technology is about, nor the importance of educating for good citizenship. If you are working on a paper, seek facts not opinions from people who speak before researching a subject, and therefore are talking with extremely limited knowledge, basing their opinions on personal interest, not information.
