And secondly, and not unrelated to the first item, is the question of whether an assessment of the overall school and classroom climate created by single-sex environments is not in itself important? In other words: do the students and teachers have a more positive attitude toward school as a result of single-sex classes? As a former public high school social studies teacher who encountered male students for whom I was merely an obstacle to their social life, a single sex classroom may have compelled these students to become more engaged in the curriculum rather than flirting with the opposite sex (indeed, these students made it clear to me from the start that, in spite of my best efforts, their social life is the only compelling reason they have for attending school). Some students, and some schools, may benefit from single-sex classes, not necessarily because it always leads to higher scores on standardized tests, but because it may allow some schools to create a classroom environment less disruptive to the school's overall academic mission. Unless, of course, you would like to reduce class size to under 20 students. Then, even I would concede it might not make much difference. I very much doubt the researchers from this study have spent much time of their own in a highly challenging public school classroom. Their conclusions are based on their values and their assumptions. Mine are at least based upon years of public school teaching experience.
