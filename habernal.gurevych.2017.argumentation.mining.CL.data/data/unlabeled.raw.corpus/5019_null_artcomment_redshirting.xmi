His pre-K 4 and Kindergarten teachers at the preschool made it well known that he was “way behind” academically. He was the youngest in his class. His speech therapist whose opinion I had come to trust over the year she saw him, felt that it would be good for his self-esteem. So, when it came time for him to attend the public school, I simply registered him for Kindergarten &amp; not First Grade. Since then, he has more than kept up academically. Socially, I still think he is behind, even when his peers are younger. Would I have done things differently? I don’t know. Looking back I feel that his pre-school was not a good fit for him and that caused him to be a bit withdrawn. Of course, I can only see this now that I have two more children who have had completely different experiences (at different schools). I never considered holding him back to give him an advantage. The decision was made solely for his individual benefit. I always felt that he was smart enough to catch up academically; I just did not want his self-esteem to suffer as a result of that struggel.
