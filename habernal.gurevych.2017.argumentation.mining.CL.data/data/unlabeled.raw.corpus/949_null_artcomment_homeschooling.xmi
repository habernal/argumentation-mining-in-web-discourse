Although you're in bad company, DCSF also appears confused, submitting this quote as part of their evidence to the CSF Select Committee: &#10;Home education is the education of children in and around the house by their parents or those appointed by the parents. It can be seen as a temporary or permanent alternative to the education which is provided by the state or by private schooling. &#10;Much of the education takes place out of the home and often in the company of other home educators. Plenty of time to play with all ages, unlike the artificial and rigid school system where children mostly only speak to their own narrow age group. Home educated children have a very good world view, mostly because they spend a lot of their time out and about in it, rather than cooped up in classrooms. &#10;As for schools reporting abuse, how many people are out there who never said a word about being abused despite attending school, and were never spotted by school staff? It's an incorrect assumption that schools will spot abuse except in occasional cases because teachers have enough to do with all the bureaucratic nonsense the government has imposed on them. It's also worth noting that many children who are home educated are there because of abuse at school, that the staff failed to prevent. &#10;Home visits to check for abuse should be aimed at the group most vulnerable - the under-5s. Throw in any child not in school for more than three weeks, so all families will need to have a home visit over the summer holidays, lest something bad happens. &#10;Home visits to check on education - why does it have to be at home? The previous paragraph has dealt with inspections for abuse and made it a lot less discriminatory, and has probably even aimed it better at those most likely to need it. What is being inspected? Past history has shown that many home education inspectors are sadly lacking in expertise and consider that education has to be done in one particular way, often the way that has already failed the child. &#10;The home educating community does not trust the government, with good cause. If the government wishes to engage, they will find it a lot easier to do by improving the quality of existing inspectors and providing useful services. Exchange the large stick for some believable carrots and results will most likely follow. Just don't expect trust overnight. &#10;For those concerned about &quot;if it saves just one child&quot;, go lobby your MP to have the Red Flag Rule for cars reinstated. That will probably save more lives. &#10;Oh, and government cost estimates assume willing compliance - there is plenty of talk about 'building relationships with home educators', totally missing the point that as a result of the draconian proposals, many home educators have withdrawn cooperation. Own goal there, Mr Balls, it's going to cost you far more than you think.
