Now we are expected to accommodate the Muslim religion in our schools at the expense of inconvienencing the rest of the students and staff. There is absolutely no way that this should be allowed. &#10;My son just finished school last year and when he skipped class I recieved a phone call at home in the evening to inform me to contact the school. I was held responsible to make sure he attended. After he skipped three classes he was suspended for three days, and Yes he ended up suspended three times last year. I am disabled so I'm not in a so I'm pretty much housebound and as far as I knew he was in his classes. ( Even told me how well his day went when I asked him each day when he returned from school) &#10;That's what should have been done with the Muslim students who did not return after attending prayers. The parents should have been responsible and the students suspended or disiplined if they skipped. &#10;We shouldn't have to make special arrangements for a particular group of students just because they skipped classes. &#10;We need to have the same rules, same services and accomodations for ALL students in our schools. If these parents want something more than they should send their kids to a private Muslim school.
