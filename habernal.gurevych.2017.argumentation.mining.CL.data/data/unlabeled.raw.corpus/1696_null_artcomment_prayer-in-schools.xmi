The biggest problems in public schools stem from problems in the home. The reason God has been expelled from school is because He has been expelled from more homes than I would like to believe. Many of these kids come to school with absolutely no work ethic, no moral compass, and no sense of respect for anyone including themselves. I find it hard to believe that these kids are being raised in good, God-fearing homes. &#10;To make matters worse, the school districts (who must shoulder their fair share of the blame) do not impose any real behavioral expectations for fear of lawsuits being brought by dysfunctional people who raising their children to be, well, dysfunctional people. The idea of consequences has gone out the window in favor of “self-esteem”. Let me explain why I believe self-esteem is a fallacy. No one on the face of the earth gets to determine the value of any person (including himself/herself). God alone has defined our value and He is NEVER wrong. God has determined that each one of us is worth His coming to earth in human form, dying for all of us, and coming back to life so that we may spend etermity with Him. That’s where the value of a human being is found. &#10;The argument for public funding of schools has always been that it benefits our society to have an educated populace. My question is whether that purpose is being served. Kids who are disciplinary problems are eating up all of the resources leaving the other kids to receive a third rate education. Our high school seniors are, on the average, on par with other developed nations’ 8th graders. Therefore, our tax dollars are being used to subsidize substandard education. &#10;Additionally, the schools are continuously trying to remove the possibility of failure from the equation. Without failure, we have no objective standard by which to measure success (which renders success meaningless). Without God, we have no objective standard by which we can condemn evil (rendering everything, including evil, acceptable).
