However, not all head teachers will be put off by the challenges that some children may present. There are mainstream schools out there that are inclusive and sympathetic and are willing to work with you. &#10;I am the head teacher of a mainstream primary school, and my school has a number of children in it that present like your son (from what you have posted). The reason being that the local authority SEN department know that our school has things in place to help children who need that little bit more. I have just taken a little boy with ASD / ADHD who has been permanently excluded from his previous school. Yes, I know he will be a challenge but I am confident we will meet his needs, he has visited a number of times so this is not just guess work. &#10;The point is, there are inclusive schools. I don't know where in the country you live but if I were you.....I would ring the SEN department of your local authority rather than the LA themselves and ask them which are the schools that are most inclusive and experienced with these issues. They will know. &#10;Additionally, if a school has empty places in the age group that your son is in (that is, they are not at their admissions number) then they actually cannot legally refuse your son a place. You can find out which schools have free places in your son's year group by ringing the 'Pupil Access' department of the LA and asking them to give you a list of all schools &#10;with space in Year 3 or whichever.&#10;With regard to statement help....you will need that label if your child is to get the additional help he needs. I know you may not want to label your child, but there some benefits, especially as again, schools are not allowed to discriminate against additional needs. This will also help in the transition eventually to high school as statemented children are usually given first consideration in the places war! &#10;Think on it ....hope that helps a bit."/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2024" language="en" documentId="4882" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Carol H(334)" date="19-08-12 19:59" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://www.netmums.com/coffeehouse/advice-support-40/special-needs-disabilities-support-502/809172-fighting-keep-my-son-mainstream-school-all.html" topic="mainstreaming" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="4882" notes="" title="fighting to keep my son in mainstream school"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="9"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="10" end="313"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="314" end="865"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="866" end="1170"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="1171" end="1535"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="1536" end="1570"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="63" sofa="1" begin="1571" end="1985"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="1986" end="2024"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59 63 67"/></xmi:XMI>
