I am a hands on mum. I am very involved in my children's education. I am there for homework, projects, daily readings, and &quot;help out&quot; in the classroom when I can. I don't work. That is a sacrifice that our family has made. I was privately educated in the top school. I went to uni double degree. My husband is publicly educated and we met in the same uni course. What I found interesting was that the workpeople around me at the top companies came from a mix of private and public schooling. I didn't like private schooling. There was an elitist attitude which is unrealistic in the &quot;real&quot; world where you eventually end up working and making a living. I haven't kept in contact with any/many school kids and their contacts have not proven to be advantageous in any way. I believe if you want to get there- you will get there, maybe not immediately. We choose not to send out children to private schools because we believe that teachers and schools ARE NOT responsible for teaching our children. We as parents are the teachers. Where I cannot teach, we pay for tutoring and coaching ($2,500 pa), extra-curricular lessons in music, sport, etc which comes from the money saved ($25,000 per child). It all comes down to choice. And we wouldn't have it either way. Besides, all the schools in the north shore area are very good anyway. &#10;Teachers ARE responsible for teaching our children in the academic sense otherwise schools are just massive day care centres with some very overpaid, overqualified staff. Our job as parents is to support and encourage our child's education, though I am sure some parents pay a private school in the hope they will do this for them.
