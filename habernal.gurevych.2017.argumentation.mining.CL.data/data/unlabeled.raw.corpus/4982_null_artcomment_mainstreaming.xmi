She was not able to walk un-assisted, she needed support to sit up, druelled constantly, developmentally delayed, frequent body tremors, kind of in a daze all the time, clenched left hand, choking on her food, speach problems, left side weakness etc tec. She was elevated on her toes when holding her to walk, she was splinted for a leg brace &amp; they wanted to give her botox, but after researching botox and discovering how its made and there were no long term studies I decided against it. Her life was restricted &amp; so was mine ...and it looked this way for the rest of her life ... &amp; mine. I felt hopeless. &#10;We were attending all sorts of treatments and therapies which cost a lot. A friend told me about some special wellness supplements from a particular company, she started taking them in her yogurt, after one week she was up walking un-assisted, it made an immense difference to her brain function, memory, balance, mood &amp; cognition in a short space of time. I was elated! &#10;I am so grateful to the person that told me about this incredible technology. She now has a life now ….. and so do I. Its now over 14 yrs later and she continues to take these special nutrients, now she is almost 16, in a few weeks she begins driving lessons and has just started an after school casual job in a fast paced food takeaway. She has attended normal public schools with no problems. &#10;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.navig8.biz/LifeStyle2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onmousedown=&quot;track_link(this);&quot;&gt;http://www.navig8.biz/LifeStyle2&lt;/a&gt;"/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1613" language="en" documentId="4982" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Caroline" date="07/03/2012" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://www.circleofmoms.com/my-angel-has-cerebral-palsy/mainstream-schooling-vs-special-education-233484" topic="mainstreaming" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="4982" notes="" title="Mainstream schooling vs. Special Education"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="702"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="703" end="1074"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="1075" end="1470"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="1471" end="1613"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51"/></xmi:XMI>
