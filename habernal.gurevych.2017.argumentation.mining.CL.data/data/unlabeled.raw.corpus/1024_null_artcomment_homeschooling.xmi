We the governed deserve that in the end. &#10;Put aside what you think about home education.&#10;To be honest, when this debate started, I warned my partner that as a home educating family if it was in fact true that home education was found to be used as a cover for forced marriages...... that we would rightfully face new laws and regulations. &#10;So here is what we need to ask ourselves on the process;&#10;1.) Did this Government order a review based on a preconceived notion?&#10;2.) Was the Badman review conducted thoroughly, impartially and without prejudice?&#10;Here are the facts;&#10;1.) This Government had just completed a review and published extensive guidelines in December 2007 that have yet to work!! &#10;2.) Ed Balls accepted the Badman report 100% within hours, not days, of its release. Does that reflect thorough government review or a preconceived notion? &#10;3.) The Consultation Process REQUIRES that the views of stakeholders be considered before any legislation is written. This Government has already proposed the legislation and plans it for the Queens speech. That was all done before either the general consultation closed or the Select Committee submissions closed or even the Select Committee releasing its reports. &#10;4.) This Government by its neglectful actions, refuses to have the Badman Report face the scrutiny by the UK National Statistics Authority, the body that gives the stamp of approval on government statistics. The limited data used, which home educators have been able to pull out via the Freedom of Information act, in fact shows that home educators are less likely to cause abuse in any manner!! &#10;Lastly, on 28 October 2009, while facing tremendous professional embarrassment, Graham Badman wrote the following to Barry Sherman, MP Chairman of the Select Committee; &#10;Now I am back to my original premise.&#10;Regardless of your own opinions and assumptions, do you want laws based on &quot;facts&quot; in the &quot;badman method&quot; to govern yourself? &#10;Badman himself has now gone in record, in writing, that there are no differences in safeguarding!!! &#10;Home education may need new laws, I do not know because a proper study has yet to be done!!"/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2672" language="en" documentId="1024" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="MidlandsStewart" date="07 November 2009 12:59pm" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/6754050" topic="homeschooling" thumbsUp="7" thumbsDown="0" origId="1024" notes="" title="Ridiculous rules for home schools"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="145"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="146" end="288"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="289" end="405"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="406" end="569"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="570" end="616"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="617" end="867"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="63" sofa="1" begin="868" end="924"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="925" end="995"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="71" sofa="1" begin="996" end="1078"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="75" sofa="1" begin="1079" end="1098"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="79" sofa="1" begin="1099" end="1223"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="83" sofa="1" begin="1224" end="1380"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="87" sofa="1" begin="1381" end="1747"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="91" sofa="1" begin="1748" end="2144"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="95" sofa="1" begin="2145" end="2314"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="99" sofa="1" begin="2315" end="2352"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="103" sofa="1" begin="2353" end="2479"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="107" sofa="1" begin="2480" end="2580"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="111" sofa="1" begin="2581" end="2672"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59 63 67 71 75 79 83 87 91 95 99 103 107 111"/></xmi:XMI>
