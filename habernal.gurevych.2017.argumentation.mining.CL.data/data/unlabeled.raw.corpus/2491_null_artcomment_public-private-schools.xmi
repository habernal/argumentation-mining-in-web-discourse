They dumb it down. The highly gifted can't stand it.  Not talking about economic class here. I'm talking about a philosophy of mendacity and control. &quot;The only thing that interferes with my learning is my education.&quot; Einstein Education should be alive and vibrant with debates, research, inventions. Diversify. Don't cram calculus down the dancer's throat.  Thank God Jimi Hendrix dropped out. Public education hasn't the spine to encourage vigorous debate and reflection on the issues of the day. They're too stupid to comprehend that separating church from state is not a green flag for silence on the issue - how else to keep everyone ignorant. I am tremendously grateful for having gone to great private schools. I wish public education would figure it out. I really think the problem is that they really aren't all that smart. Same with the religions. It's too much about control and not enough about the spirit, the heart, and the soul of man. Why else all these horrific wars based on bullsh*t.  But what else would you expect from home grown cattle fed on mendacity? We need a vibrant public education system. Yes. But where are the leaders? We have none. They assassinated most of them in the sixties and seventies. Maybe if the so-called teachers and administrators would  really teach and debate and open up the world, things would start happening. Give the clowns in congress the SAT in Greek and put them on probation till they get it right. Meanwhile, redirect bribes they've received from the military, oil companies, Monsanto and Pharmacies and apply them to public education. Oh, yeah. I'm for public education. But education with a bite in it. Not the milk toast of today. For that, you've got to take the above mentioned seriously and deal with them. Actually, throwing money at the problem won't solve it. You want a Renaissance?You need enlightened people who are courageous, experienced and dedicated to serving. Cut the artists loose. Cut the scientists loose. Put the bullies in jail. I'm not talking about the student bullies so much as professional bullies in congress, senate and the supreme court. You got high school seniors studying WWII while we take on Syria. Make no mistake about it. The cattle are being groomed.
