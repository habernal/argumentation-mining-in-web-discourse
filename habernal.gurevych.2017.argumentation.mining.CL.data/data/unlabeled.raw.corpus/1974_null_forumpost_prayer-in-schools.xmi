Obviously god hasn't spoke then because I haven't heard him. I haven't seen these tablets, I only know that men wrote what was supposedly on these tablets in a book. Even if some tablets existed, you would still have to demonstrate how fire from a burning bush that doesn't get consumed could write in hebrew. If you couldn't demonstrate this, then I'm left with no choice but to think they are a forgery. &#10;Yet you choose to believe some invisable friend in the sky wrote on some tablets???&#10;And who presented the tablets to you? Which version of the tablets were you presented with?What contradiction?What basis? The first 5 rules are B.S. for the simple fact that there isn't any credible evidence to support this god. The second 5 rules are common rules that have been around LONG before the story of the tablets come into being. If the rules could be re-written, it should include Thou shalt not molest children. &#10;fair enough.&#10;History books don't express opinions on how to interpret the events. I'll agree that history is often written by the victor. But what does &quot;many references&quot; to the 10C's have to do with this? There are many books that reference Unicorns, leprechauns and magic flying fairies, but none of these exist either. &#10;The different references don't really contradict each other, they say pretty much the same thing with different wording. There is no statistical significance here. AS I said before, many use to think the earth was flat. &#10;You know what they say about opinions, right?&#10;OK, so if it's unacceptable in our current society, wouldn't you agree that it would be acceptable to break the rule about honoring such a parent? Ummm there has never been a society that condones the molestation if small children. There is a difference between a society that condone sexual activity at say 13 than one that does at 5. I agree that many societies have married off 13 year olds or when the girl has come of age by mentration, but there has never been one that condones this at age 5. Oh wait, you wrote more...... &#10;Well if your god was thinking, he would have written &quot;Thou shalt not kidnap children&quot; this is one rule that could last for milleniums. There are no societies that condone this type of behavior. &#10;Doesn't matter what I think could last for 10000 years. The basic moral code that humans have lived by were around long before your tablet story came about. You also seem to forget that there a large numbers of people (1 billion hindus for example) that don't believe in your god nor do they worship him, so the 1st 5 rules don't apply to them and they never have and probably never will. &#10;Like not molesting small children? Not kidnapping them? Not beating your wife? How about &quot;Thou shalt not believe in any gods until one shows up that everyone can agree upon is the one true god.&quot; &#10;Debate is one thing. Unsupported opinion is another, and thats all you've offered."/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2954" language="en" documentId="1974" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="ItsDarts" date="30th November 2006 10:59 AM" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://www.volconvo.com/forums/showthread.php?t=11753&amp;page=7" topic="prayer-in-schools" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="1974" notes="" title="The Bible in Public Schools"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="460"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="461" end="544"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="545" end="970"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="971" end="983"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="984" end="1292"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="1293" end="1513"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="63" sofa="1" begin="1514" end="1559"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="1560" end="2090"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="71" sofa="1" begin="2091" end="2285"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="75" sofa="1" begin="2286" end="2675"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="79" sofa="1" begin="2676" end="2871"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="83" sofa="1" begin="2872" end="2954"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59 63 67 71 75 79 83"/></xmi:XMI>
