One of my friend's moms didn't think she could teach her daughter advanced math, so she took that online. Or another friend's mom knew nothing about history, so the girl was in a co-op for that. &#10;The issue with homeschooling lies (I believe) in the lack of regulation. Because for some people, it's really awesome. But for some people, it's easier to fall through the cracks. It's easier to complete a homeschooling curriculum than a public school curriculum with below-grade-level reading skills if it's not regulated. For example, in California, to graduate public school, you need to pass the CAHSEE, which is the CA High School Exit Exam. And you need that to get your diploma. But if you're home schooled, you don't need to pass it (if you're private schooled either, but if you're at an accredited private school they have their own strict requirements). So it's easier to get missed. &#10;&#10;RE: Public School&#10;It's awesome for some people. It's not awesome for others. I would not have survived my local public school, and would have been extremely unhappy. It's not a very good school (I live very much in the middle of a city, and my local high school is the stereotypical inner city high school, and has a decent amount of gang violence, and is very underfunded), and I got super lucky and somehow am getting an education at a really good private school with a lot more money. &#10;Meanwhile, friends I have at the public high school 10 minutes away are getting into top universities. &#10;Basically, the fact that schools are funded by property taxes isn't so great, because rich people get good public schools because their expensive homes pay for the schools, and poorer neighborhoods have not as great schools because they're not getting the money because there aren't a ton of property taxes in that area. &#10;&#10;RE: Private School&#10;It's an experience. Overall, I think it's been a positive experience, but it has most definitely been an experience.
