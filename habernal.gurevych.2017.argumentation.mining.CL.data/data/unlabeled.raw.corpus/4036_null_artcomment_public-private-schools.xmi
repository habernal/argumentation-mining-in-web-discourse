My parents made me go to a catholic school from K-8th grade. I hated it. All of our text books were 20-30 years out dated, had to wear stupid uniforms, were made to pray and take religion class, go to church every Friday, stop do the sign of the cross when passing the crucifix outside the principles office. A teacher I had in 8th grade grabbed me by the hair and shook my head violently cause she caught me laughing during a prayer before math class. This was in the 90's. The teachers were mean as sh!t the other kids were as mean if not meaner that public school kids. Some @$$hole broke my glasses in 4th grade on purpose, had to memorize a stupid school theme song, was told homosexuality was evil and immoral. By the time I got to public High School I was very socially awkward for the 1st year. The education was far from better than public schools. They teach you to be very judgmental and closed minded. I was judging people when I really had NO right to. Quite a few of the people I went to catholic school with are in jail, got pregnant in highschool, did and/or doing hardcore drugs and one killed himself earlier this year (RIP Buddy). Private schools suck. They are poison. I was bullied everyday. Thank you catholic school for making me the well-rounded Atheist I am today that realizes that we are all equal whether its race, sexual preferences......
