Students are required to go to school to learn and because their knowledge is limited. If you were to, for example, present &quot;Evidences&quot; for the Bible to a student that might be specious at best, the student wouldn't know better and might accept your word because he/she views you as a knowledgable authority. &#10;One of the things about teachers is that they will be in positions where they can present their ideas without challenge, or worse, punishing people for challenging them at all. If religion were to creep into some classrooms, all it would take is one paticularly strict teacher and one inquisitive student and you have a fundamental teacher-student(and possibly later teacher-parent) conflict on your hands. Unfortunately, if laws were passed to protect teachers from being fired based on religious issues, in such cases the administration could do nothing to said teacher. Because of this, I think it would be best if, rather then restrictingreligion in the classroom through law, the government would merely mandate that speaking on religious issues should only be allowed in what are deemed &quot;neutral&quot; enviroments of the school setting where a singular teacher does not have complete control over the class and the discussion, or better yet, that a teacher is not allowed to punish students for questioning a teachers preferred religion if the teacher is displaying and agressively trying to propogate her belief in it. In other words, we should have either have many different religious issues/facets simultaneously represented in the school setting or none mandated. &#10;Also, chemistry and evolution go hand in hand. Are you sure your teacher doesn't have a degree specifically in biochemistry? It would explain why he speaks on biological issues all the time, because after all he probably feels more comfortable speaking on what he specializes in.
