Wealthy people send their kids to private schools (even though their taxes fund public schools) for some of the same reasons that more and more families school at home -- they don't want the indoctrination that is more ongoing, the quality of education has declined in many districts, many public schools are more interested in promoting social and political causes and lines of thinking than actually teaching, and some schools have a dangerous environment that the wealthy, understandably, don't want their kids exposed to like most normal and rational parents.    The author of the article would go further in possibly persuading readers to take her seriously if she didn't refer to parents of private school kids as &quot;bad people.&quot;  It sounds like an argument being made by an 8th grader from many of today's public schools.  Newsflash to the writer: More money isn't going to change one thing in public education.  All it is going to do is to increase the amount of money going to the teachers unions, and then they'll be screraming for more money on top of that.    The writer is incredibly obnoxious and here's just one example: &quot; “I believe in public education, but my district school really isn’t good! you might say. I understand. You want the best for your child, but your child doesn't need it.&quot; &quot;Your child doesn't need it.&quot;  That is just disgusting, and quite frankly, un-American.
