I’m here to tell you that prayer is alive and well in schools all over the country. My kids do it and I know I prayed when I went to school in the 80s. It was a private prayer between my God and I. The government bears no responsibility to make me pray in school or to have anything to do with it. The public schools should be about teaching our kids math, English, history and all the rest. It should be up to the parents to teach their children their belief systems. &#10;Simply put, what God and what version of what religion do you guys want the public schools teaching our kids? What about those of different faiths? Or no faith at all? &#10;I’m all for it if you want your kids to learn about God in a school setting. You can send them to a private school for that. Let me decide how to teach my kids about our faith. &#10;The battle has been drawn over this and the “godly” side seems to be able to lie very well to get their point across. By saying God isn’t allowed in schools or that prayer is banned in schools is a blatant lie to get people to action. If your child or teacher has God in their heart, then God is already allowed in school. We tell our kids that the best way to witness to someone is to do the right thing all the time, even when they don’t think anyone is looking. Be a good kid and others will know it without being told. &#10;The other lie is that prayer is not allowed in schools. It might be allowed to organized by a school official, but kids pray all the time. They hold Bible classes at lunch or talk to their friends about God. My kids actually walk across the street during school hours for a class on the Bible. The school district not only knows this, but they encourage the classes if that is what the kids and their parents want to do. &#10;I can’t help but think that anytime God hears someone who professes to be one of His followers that He isn’t allowed in school, he shakes his head at such a blantant lie.
