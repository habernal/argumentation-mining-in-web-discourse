Each of her students could sing, write, read, and do algebra by eighth grade graduation. Two of my grandmother's students became nationally famous, and one became internationally famous. She did all of this with an eight grade education of her own. ( I, on the other hand, have a M.A. - don't you think I could do just as well as she did with my higher formal education level and fewer students?) &#10;I am sorry that this boy feels like he missed out, but (newsflash) almost all of us have to do &quot;remedial&quot; work as we go to college. In my own case, my public high school decided to &quot;cancel&quot; Chemistry and Calc due to low enrollment in the classes. I studied that summer on my own (home-schooling!) and took the classes at college level that fall. &#10;To the public school teachers I would say. &quot;Results, not excuses&quot;. Maybe your teaching credential isn't what it is cracked-up to be, you know? Most public school teachers are continually whining about how they need higher and higher salaries (funded by the tax payer). It must be very difficult for them to understand how a home-schooling parent could give up a high-paying career and do this work for free. It is truly a gift of love from the parent to the child. Some of us do not want our children raised on the Prussian education system ( &#10;that teaches them to respond like Pavlov's dog to bells, lines, rewards, and other conditioning so that they can learn to be good factory workers and cogs in the wheel. Our family believes that each individual is made in the image of God and is a creative individual, not a member of the &quot;collective&quot;. &#10;P.S. The proof is in the pudding. My oldest child is a senior at an Ivy university, the second is attending a highly selective tech university.
