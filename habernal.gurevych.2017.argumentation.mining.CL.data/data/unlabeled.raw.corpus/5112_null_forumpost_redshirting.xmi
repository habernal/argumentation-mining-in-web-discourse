Of course people are welcome to do that with their children and it doesn't matter to me. I just personally wouldn't do it. I think that redshirting is something that should be considered on a case by case basis as kindergarten is approaching, taking into consideration a child's overall readiness. &#10;Both of my children have birthdays about a month before the cutoff. When my first was in preschool, in the spring the main teacher mentioned that I could redshirt dd if I wanted, mainly because she was so shy. I asked her for research on the topic so I could make an informed decision. She had none. I did my own research and basically found there would not be any benefit for her. She was academically ready, and the assistant teacher, who knew her better, felt she was socially ready. Well, she went to K on time, and was fine. She was still quiet/shy - she's a sophomore in high school now and she's still quiet, it's just who she is, which I knew. She's also always done well academically - she has a high GPA, taking honors and AP classes, lettered in academics, etc. Socially does just fine with her peer group. &#10;My second child I had more hesitation about but she did well in K screening and seemed ready. i just wasn't sure about her being emotionally mature enough for a full day. (K had changed from half day to all day, every other day between my two kids). We sent her on time. She did have a bit of an adjustment period the first few months of K. Nothing major but she was showing some signs of anxiety and such. By November she was doing fine. In first grade she ended up being behind in reading - so again, I wondered if perhaps she would have benefited by another year at home. &#10;But, by the end of 1st grade she was caught up in reading. By third grade she was the top reader in her class. Her test scores improved dramatically over those early years of elementary. She's been in an advanced program for reading, too. Now she is in middle school, in advanced math, gets very good grades, is very, very smart. Has always gotten along well with her peers, has lots of friends. &#10;Both of mine were also among the smallest in their grade - they had late birthdays but also were really short for their age. But by middle school that changed. &#10;So I just haven't regretted not redshirting, but that makes sense given our circumstances. When I went to K orientation when my first was approaching K, the principal of the school said, &quot;We take your child where they are, and we move them forward.&quot; Well, that's exactly what they did. They each got what they needed to learn, to be challenged, and to excel. &#10;But the right decision for another child might be something different."/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2789" language="en" documentId="5112" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="FlowerGirl" date="04/03/2012" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://community.babycenter.com/post/a32503567/yet_another_redshirting_debate?cpg=6" topic="redshirting" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="5112" notes="" title="Yet another redshirting debate"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="405"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="406" end="1224"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="1225" end="1800"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="1801" end="2197"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="2198" end="2358"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="2359" end="2718"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="63" sofa="1" begin="2719" end="2789"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59 63"/></xmi:XMI>
