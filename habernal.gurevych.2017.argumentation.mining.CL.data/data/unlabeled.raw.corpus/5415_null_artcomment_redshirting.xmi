II have a friend in NYC with the same situation and she says that it is very difficult bureaucratically to hold a child back there so nearly everyone sends their kids “on time”. She has a daughter with a mid-Dec birthday who went at age 4-turning-5, struggled a bit at first but is now in fine shape as a 3rd grader. Where I live, there is no problem holding a child back a year (no justification required) and in fact you can hold a child back ANOTHER year (yes, start at age 7!) under special circumstances. There is constantly talk of moving the cutoff date back and changing the hold-back rule but nothing has happened yet. What tends to happen is that fall-birthday kids, and increasingly summer birthday kids, are held back in wealthier towns (where parents can afford preschool/another year of day daycare) and sent “on-time” in less wealthy areas. And this may one factor in the significant gap in test scores between wealthier and poorer areas of the state (one of the worst in the country). &#10;So my experience – I live in a nice town that takes education seriously, kindergarten went to fullday a few years ago and there is an expanding public preK program being developed (although not yet at my elem school). Both my kids (girl, boy) have October birthdays and so I have spent ridiculous amounts of time thinking about this issue. My daughter was ready to go “on time”, she was advanced academically and needed to be in school. My son I will probably hold back. I have found that most girls with fall birthdays are sent, while most boys are held back. A local friend has a boy with a mid-August birthday (4.5 months before the cutoff!) who is the youngest boy in his class. It’s getting pushed back more and more and for boys there is pretty much a de facto cutoff of Sept 1 already. In any place there will be about a year’s difference between the oldest and youngest kids in the classroom. But here there is can be an 18 months difference, and that is huge when you are talking about kids ages 4.5 and 6. Frankly it bothers me when people want to hold their kids back who turn 5 before the start of school – it isn’t really fair to the ones who are going on time. But every kindergarten teacher I’ve spoken with has told me – whether they know my kids or not – to hold them back. One told me that in just about any other state my kids wouldn’t be eligible, so is it really holding them back? It’s not like the curriculum is adjusted for potentially having 4 year olds in the classroom for 4 months of the school year, in fact the curriculum gets more advanced every year. &#10;It’s such a hard decision, and if I had my way I would have had spring babies so as not to worry about this. My daughter is doing fine but I do worry about when she is 15 and all the boys in her grade are 17. And I worry the opposite about my son. But knowing what I know about how it all works in our school, I’m about 90% sure we’ll hold him back and we are looking for a third year of preschool now (his current school only does 2 years and I don’t want to repeat him there). I wish I had waited to start him in preschool until he was 3-turning-4. The public preK at the elem school would be perfect for him and I hope that will be available for the fall (it’s in the works but funding is always the issue).
