Here is my two cents. A person is not given an education.  The purpose of a school (whether public, private or religious) is to HELP a person get an education.  It is and always will be, up to the individual to get that education.  Each person only gets out of education what they put into it, from the very youngest all the way to the PhD.  No one can be forced to learn anything they don't want to learn. Parents who feel they have little influence over their child's education are sadly misinformed.  In actuality, parents have the greater influence over their child's education.  I truly believe that what happens when a child walks through that door at home after a day at school, is very important.  By that I mean the support that a child receives at home.  Is there someone to make sure homework is done and checked? Is there someone who will initiate open ended questions and conversation and listen quietly while the child speaks?  Is there someone who takes notice of the child's learning?  There are many children who go to so called crappy schools, who succeed in education and in life. I think that some parents sell themselves short when they depend on a school to give an education rather than the school helping the student get an education. I think that parents sell themselves short when they think the school their child attends has greater influence than the parents "/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1479" language="en" documentId="2884" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="Rosebude" date="Aug 29, 2013 8:05PM" docType="artcomment" origUrl="http://living.msn.com/family-parenting/the-family-room-blog-post?post=ab228ffc-1e99-4b37-a7b8-0b6a4c3fb240" topic="public-private-schools" thumbsUp="5" thumbsDown="0" origId="2884" notes="" title="Is it wrong to send kids to private school?"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="1479"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39"/></xmi:XMI>
