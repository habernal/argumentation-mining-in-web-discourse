I doubt such a broad person exists in society at large, let alone among those parents who would deny their children professionally-done education based upon their religion. &#10;To be sure, home schooling for a time as part of a child's education can be a rich and rewarding experience, providing experiences unavailable within a school. But an important and essential part of education is for the student to surpass and transcend his or her teachers. An education limited by teachers is no education at all. Nobody has both the knowledge of all subjects taught through high school, and the ability to clearly and creatively present all of them. Not even the most educated people can do that! Perhaps some parents can do a better job in a few subjects than can any school available to them, but not up and down the entire school curriculum. &#10;But even that is irrelevant in the case of Josh Powell. Evidently his parents are not just deficient in some subjects. They appear deficient in all! After teaching their children, evidently of high intelligence, and failing to teach them to read or to do basic algebra, it should be clear to Josh's parents that they are failing globally as teachers. &#10;The need for education is independent of a child's or parent's religion. The requirement that a child obtain such an education ought also to be independent of the child's or parent's religion. As for those parents who use their religion as a pretext not to competently educate their children, such religion is just plain vile!
