I think that is a ridiculously late cut-off. So he would barely be 4 1/2 when he started kindergarten. He is smart and would probably do fine academically, but he is still immature socially and emotionally and I think that being possibly as much as a year and a half younger than some of his classmates, he would really struggle. So, after many arguments with my husband about it, we are holding him back a year. I'm not even so concerned about kindergarten as I am about later in his school years. He would always be one of the youngest, and potentially smallest (we're both shorter) kids in his class. Here also, it is a huge fight to get them to hold a child back, even if it really is warrented. so if he starts out way behind, he continues way behind. I don't see the value in starting him out that way. But I see it differently because of our late cut-off, than holding back a child with a summer or early fall birthday. My second one's birthday is Sept. 7. Unless there is a major issue, we won't be holding him back. I just don't see any reason for it. Like others said, if the child is not ready, and I honestly don't believe Cole would be by this fall, then by all means, hold them back. But otherwise, I think any advantage is kind of imaginary, especially if almost everyone is holding their children back a year now. &#10;Since our legal drinking age is 18 here, Cole will be one of the few kids in his class who can drink at his highschool grad. Actually, hmmm, maybe we should send him early! ;) &#10;I actually thought the law here was that if the child is 6 by September of the current year, they have to start gr. 1. But maybe I'm wrong? Hmmm.
