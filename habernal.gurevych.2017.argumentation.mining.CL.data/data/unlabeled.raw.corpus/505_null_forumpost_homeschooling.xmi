They give home schoolers a bad name. IMO.* &#10;Yeah, me too. Just to give you two examples:&#10;1. My husband has a student who he sort of mentors. He only teaches two grades, but he will have ultimately taught her for three years and been in some touch with her in the fourth year (she lives across the street from us, and we see her in the community). This is because her family chose to &quot;homeschool&quot; her after 7th grade, which she failed while in the public alternative Ed program. This &quot;homeschooling&quot; seemed to consist of tasking her with babysitting her siblings for free while she worked her way through notebooks and computer programs at home in a self-directd program. Not shockingly, she failed. She returned for a third year of 7th grade two years ago. &#10;2. My niece, who was raised by religious zealots with minimal education, was &quot;homeschooled&quot; near the end of high school because she found it onerous to attend school, and they didn't want her exposed to, say, evolution. Technically she has graduated, but there is not a single accredited college in her state that will admit her without substantial remedial work. &#10;On the other end, personally, I feel that a high school diploma or equivalent is probably the bare minimum necessary to permit you to educate your children adequately as their primary educator. However, I have these crazy friends who essentially homeschool because they hate authority and they performed very poorly in public schools themselves -- one has a GED and the other a high school diploma. They're doing a great job with their daughters, however, and are very focused on educating them to be self-governing, capable, and creative. They also use state standards to guide their lesson planning, so that their daughters will get all the same core knowledge that a child in a public school would get.
