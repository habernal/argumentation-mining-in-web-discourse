Homeschooling is better in pretty much all ways. But public school is better in a way that I hadn't thought about, and a reason that I may go back. The situation that I am in is that My sisters and I are going to college. Next year they are going to a college farther away, versus the community college that I go to. I live in the middle of nowhere and I still need to get an education, so I might have to go to public school because I can't go into town any other way. I'd still be doing college classes, its just that I would use Public school as a means of free transportation and maybe a much faster degree, if you combine the college classes and high school classes for credits. What I am trying to say is the &quot;x factor&quot; There are always unique positions that make you need to choose one over the other. In an Ideal modern world, homescooling is superior because of th access to knowledge that we have. Public schooling was created so that we could get an education for free. Well you can do that anyways, now. Public schooling is starting to be described as a &quot;tradition&quot; by social scientists. I would highly prefer homeschooling over public schooling, but due to the x factor I may have to go back to public schooling. I guesse that I will just have to rally up the people with squishy minds so I may manipulate them into my virtual slave army. All arguments and jokes aside, we need to remember the &quot;x factor&quot;.
