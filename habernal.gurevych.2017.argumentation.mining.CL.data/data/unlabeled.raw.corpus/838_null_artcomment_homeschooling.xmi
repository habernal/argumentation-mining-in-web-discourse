I know that all the parents I know personally who home educate fall into 2 camps: either their child has been excluded and failed to find a new school or situation (something that is FAR more likely to happen with the meteoric rise of academies), and they are usually, although not always, from the lower end of the social and financial scale, or they are wealthy, and professional, able to afford to have one income. &#10;The socialisation of the home educated child depends very much on who you know. Sure, you can meet other home eds online, IF you have access, but if there isn't someone around nearby to share teaching and ideas with, and you don't have a car, it's pretty solitary. If you don't have the money to go swimming, do judo, do those extra-curricular things that mean socialisation and FUN for your kid, then you can't do it. Yes, you can do a lot for free, but it's nonetheless true that for a lot of parents contemplating home education, money is a vital factor. &#10;I agree that lessons in school are too long, often. Too much of the day is about sitting down and listening. The day itself is too long. The kids even start school too young, in my opinion. However, socialisation at school is NOT just about playtimes. It's about the ability to access FREE sports facilities after school, sports clubs, (well, maybe, i'll have to check with Gove again...), drama clubs, street dance clubs, the library, the swimming pool, the art club. I used to run the History club: we visited the war bunker sites, constructed a nuclear shelter, played endless war games with little figures plotting the route of the Telemark skiers. But it was really about a group of kids with shared interests coming together, having a good time, and doing it for FREE, with nothing but the goodwill of their geeky history teacher to pay for with the occasional &quot;thanks&quot;. I don't remember my own school days being hives of society at lunchtimes either, but I did have a fabulous time in the school theatre productions. It's this sort of thing that gives confidence, grows friendship groups and educates, as well, that home educators, unless they are wealthy enough to pay and travel to activities, do miss out on.
