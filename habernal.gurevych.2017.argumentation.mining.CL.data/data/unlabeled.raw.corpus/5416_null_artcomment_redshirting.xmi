A May birthday actually seems “old” to me! My daughter is THE YOUNGEST in her class as she has a late August birthday. We struggled with it, but she was READY. Every single check list for “Are they ready?” was passed with flying colors. She knew her letters, some sounds, numbers, shapes, could sit still forever, had lots of friends, was responsible with belongings, had manners, etc. One of our biggest concerns was the physical–that when puberty hits, she will not be ready, but we figured that we would have to deal with puberty when it finally happens. I was a young one in my class, so I was a “late bloomer”. My husband was an oldest kid in the class, and still grew later in life. You cannot predict. Sounds like your child is already one of the biggest in the class, so that should not be a problem. &#10;I totally think it depends on the child though. If my next child was an August birthday, I can almost guarentee that she would have been “redshirted”. She is just much more impulsive than our first child. I don’t think you can just look at the birthdate of children to make the decision. You have to LOOK at the actual child. I am a teacher, and many times I can tell the youngest children based on maturity, but not always. I have had classes where the most immature children in the class are the OLDEST, not the YOUNGEST children. &#10;I also hate preschools where they try to push redshirting children. For example, the first preschool my daughter went to (and only 1/2 day once a week, just to get her feet wet at age 3), gave us the “summer birthday talk”. They gave it to every single set of parents that had a June, July, or August child. Basically they told us that those kids were not going to be mature enough to handle kindergarten at 5. B.S.!!!! My daughter was academically more ready, and behaviorally more mature, than a couple of her friends. One of her friends is an April baby, and her parents did not get “the talk”. The kid still is struggling with getting up in the morning to go to school, and there are tons of tears, but since she was not a summer birthday, no talk. Another friend is May 28th, and there was no “talk”, but still another was June 1, and they got the talk!! I realize there are plenty of kids that go to school that are not ready, but I also know that most parents know their children better than anyone in the world, and ultimately it falls to their decision. If my child starts struggling academically, socially, or emotionally in school, I am the one that will have to deal with it. And I will. So I also realize that if I make (made) the decision to send my daughter at 5, instead of waiting until 6, that it was MY decision, and I had to live with it!! &#10;One last thought–at least you (and others) are using the term “redshirting” for sending at age 6. Around my area “stupid” people call sending children at age 5, “sending early”, as opposed to sending at 6. I did not send my child to school “early”, I sent her when she was age ready to go to school. Would she be better waiting until 6? Possibly, but I guess I will never know that.
