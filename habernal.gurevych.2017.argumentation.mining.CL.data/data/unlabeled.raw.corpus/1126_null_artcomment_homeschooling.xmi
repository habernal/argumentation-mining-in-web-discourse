Er, no ... most children were not 'educated' as we understand it at all - and people like Isaac Newton would have had tutors and been very much the exception. And the Grammar school that I went to back in the 1960s claimed a history back to 1594, so don't try to say that schools are new fangled ideas, because it doesn't wash. &#10;I am sure that there are many parents who educate their children at home for the best of reasons, and I am not going to say that they are wrong to do that per se (although I need convincing that there are not going to be gaps in that education, and many things lost that cannot be replaced (please, nobody go on about bullying)). But for every parent with purely unselfish motives, I suspect there is at least one - and probably more - who are motivated by a need to be in complete control of all aspects of their childrens' lives, either because of their own psychological needs or through religeous conviction. &#10;On balance, I come down against home education, and suspect the motives of home educators - especially those who do it from day one. At least people who take their kids out of school have presumably done so because they can see that their child is beig damaged by it, and they think they can (and maybe can) do better.
