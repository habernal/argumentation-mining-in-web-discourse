I'm sure that this woman is well meaning but has she REALLY endangered her children in the likes of a &quot;bad school&quot; you know the kind, where bullying is the norm, the teachers could care less as they are paid less than a janitor or some of the bus drivers, and the administration cares more about their personal investment portfolios, peeping with cameras in bathrooms, strip searching the kids, defending the pervert cop teaching the kids where the drug houses are, targeting the special ed kids for the WRONG kind of &quot;special treatment&quot; and worse... That is the &quot;public school&quot; I had to deal with here.  My introduction to it was to be told by the school principal that because my oldest was doing Fourth grade work going into 2nd grade and testing in the advanced range he &quot;was OBVIOUSLY MALADJUSTED AND WOULD HAVE TO JUST SIT AND WAIT FOR THE REST OF THE KIDS TO CATCH UP!&quot;   My oldest was fresh from a wonderful Private school at my last station. The reason for the Private school?  Because despite his intelligence and social ability he was NOT ALLOWED to enter Kindergarten because his birthday was ONE DAY past the Public school cutoff. My Middle child spent his entire time in that public school BEGGING to go elsewhere. He was dumped into every special ed program for more money then yanked, bullied and harassed and when he started making web pages at home and programming in6 computer languages on his own they tried to arrest him for it! He was helping the local police set up their computers so they refused  the school. Finally my youngest, I had retired from the military and started to look into the weird things going on at that school. The result being my daughter was stalked, threatened, harassed to the point she became ill. I moved her to another district temporarily and looked into home schooling and decided to give it a try..  We found local home school groups, curriculum, athletic programs, music programs and more all geared toward homeschoolers. For her the flexibility and chance to learn at her own pace made all the difference.  Here is the end result: the oldest learned to be lazy waiting for those kids to catch up but despite that and a very difficult time adjusting to college actually being demanding he has a very good job and family. The middle one, has a family,  but struggles to get by in a low paying job despite his obvious intelligence and I'm left wondering if I'd agreed to his requests for private or homeschooling if things would have been far different . He's the only one that spent all his schooling with the public system. My youngest is dealing with health issues but despite that has a good marriage and when well consults and programs as an independent contractor to some high tech companies.
