I spoke to a number of teachers and regular everyday people also. The teachers state &quot;No child left behind&quot; is ridiculous.  They have to spend more time teaching non-English speaking children and children with learning deficiencies than teach the class as a whole. The regular kids and kids of gifted learning ability are left to their own devices. There isn't enough school books for each child to have a book.  No discipline is allowed by the teacher and so the kids are temporarily removed from the class and then show up a few days later. Then the kid does the same thing again. Stealing is rampant and no action is taken against the thief. Same thing with kids with drugs, fighting, on and on. I had one woman state that 3 kids beat up her son regularly and stole everything he had (shoes, shirt, pants, lunch money, school supplies) She finally got the police involved and had the kids arrested. The school did everything they could to protect the 3 kids and nothing to protect her son.  She finally agreed to drop the charges IF she could transfer her child to another school in the area (outside city limits and more white than her son's current school), which they agreed to. My own granddaughter who lives with me was  The school and/or teacher/principal did nothing to this girl when she made this statement. I went to the school and asked that my grand-daughter be removed from that classroom but was declined.  My granddaughter was beaten up until finally she defended herself and was able to return the blows she was getting. School gave each girl 2 days in-school suspension which I had to remove her from because the same girl still wanted to fight right in the in-school suspension area. When I went to the school to get her school work to do, her teacher was mad that she was fussed out by the principal about her NOT being in the classroom and what had occurred was her fault. The teacher felt sympathy for the poor black girl who came from a poor family and troubled family life. I'm sorry but thats not my problem. I'm sending my child there to get an education and not to get beaten up. Her clothes have been stolen and my grand-daughter caught the girl with her stuff and the school did nothing. I live off SSA retirement only and its hard to get her the clothes she needs. I even shop consignment stores for her, but its OK for someone to steal her stuff. You can't imagine the storys I've heard about how these students and staff of school act. Bullied kids by teachers and students. Private schools are the only way a Mother and Father can be assured their kids are actually being taught and that they won't be killed while at school. Not talking about a mentally ill student coming in with a gun. It's dangerous enough just to go to school. Charter schools are great but unfortunately in my area the doctors, lawyers and Indian Chiefs make sure only the right kind of children gets into those schools. Their lottery system has some kinks in it for sure. Every dentist, doctor I know has their kids going to Charter Schools and most of their staff's kids get into these charter schools. I've known people apply for 12 years and never get in. Our public schools are dumps now and if I could, I would put my grand-daughter into a private school too!
