The reason I put him there was for the safety of my son. We tried the public school the first year and was disappointed by several things. We had just moved from KS and what my son was learning in 5th grade in OK was what he learned in 3rd grade in KS. Also there was a lot of bullying. I contacted the school about it, but they were afraid to speak out to the kids and their parents because they thought it would cause race issues. My son and the principals were white and the kids bullying him were black. I tried changing him to a different public school which held us through the end of the year. That school was better because the principal was black and she didn't care who's feeling got hurt. But the following year my son would have to move on to the middle school. My friend had been a cop at the middle schools and warned me of the high gang and drug issues in all 4 of the public middle schools. At that point I tried my best to find a private school for my child. I was lucky to find the Arts &amp; Science Academy in Lawton. They taught at a higher level. The school considered them to be more of a college prep school. My son was much more comfortable there as was I. When we moved back to NY my son returned to public schools. I'm happy with the district we are in. And they teach at the same level as the private school my son went to in OK. I also noted the concern of the school up here because my son transferred from OK to NY, they were worried he'd be behind. But because he went to the private school he was right on track for the system up here. So think what you might but my son's safety is my biggest concern, second is education.
