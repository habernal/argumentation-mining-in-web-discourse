Not only have governments removed financial support but also taken much autonomy away from schools in their decision making. God forbid a private school put up with an unruly student! &#10;I was a public school student and feel that I received a good education. Both my children were public school educated but I'm reasonably sure my grandchildren won't go to public school. &#10;It's sad to think that for many children now they will never experience having to work with all until they enter the workplace. It's such a leveller! &#10;Autonomy for public schools is not the panacea that it is touted to be. Autonomous schools reflect the academic aspirations of the local community that chooses to attend that school. That means that the parents of the already academically weak students attending the school choose principals that are not academically focused. The school council then makes the false choice between nurturing the whole child and academic success when it can choose both. Needless to say the choice is made to &quot;nurture the whole child&quot;, and the school takes its focus off academic success. This scares away even more middle class parents and you have a downward spiral. We can nurture children and have academic success and it is up to the government to enforce this. &#10;I am cheering for the Blue &amp; White (Riverview College!) given that old Boys Barnaby &amp; Tony will running this country after this weekend... Put that in your pipe Joey's &amp; smoke it! &#10;My son attends the local govt primary school, and will attend one of the local govt high schools - probably not the non-selective one. I believe schooling is largely about socially adapting within a diverse community, and the exercising your brain so you can learn throughout your life. &#10;The present system which publicly rewards academic statistics (through rote-learned exams) within the school process seems to be missing the point. But it's great propaganda to a frightened market. &#10;I agree that there is now an accumulated impact of long term underinvestment. But the cause is not hopeless. Anybody interested in the topic of public education v independent education should watch the doco &quot;Waiting for Superman&quot; which talks about the rise of public funded independent charter schools in the US. It is inspirational viewing and shows how fundamentally important good leadership and academic culture are. Unfortunately, in public systems where teachers are forced to follow a one-size-fits all model, it is very difficult to address problems which are often unique to a community. &#10;Which leads me to another point - re private education only being publically funded in Aus. This is untrue. As I say above, in the USA there are indeed publically funded independent charter schools. And they are 100% publically funded. Not discount funded like our private schools are here. &#10;Reading through the comments it is apparent that the role of parenting in a child's education is not considered by many. Spending time reading to your kids when they're babies and toddlers is very valuable. So is teaching them how to count and to recognise words when out in the street. Schools can't do everything &#10;I agree with the previous commenter that parents need to be more involved.&#10;I home schooled one of mine for grade 5.&#10;I just thought he needed it. A break from conformity and mindless repetition. We even travelled a bit for some of it. &#10;But public education is what all of Europe has invested in, and they have the highest standard of education. By miles. And it's all public. And they spend less per student than us. &#10;Hey Jamoski, when was the last time an Iggies boy played for the Wallabies though (Tony Dempsey I think). Walk On Joeys! That's what my money buys. A top class rugby education. Go Kurtley!! &#10;Good on you Ian. Foundation of a person, academic and social, is in the home, not the school. I was top student in a public school unitl my paretns sent me to a private one in year 11. I hated to be amongst a bunch of upper class kids. Admittedly, I had to perform better there, as I could never again get the top spot. &#10;My children have been in Public, Catholic and Independent Schools. All the issues descibed snobbery, unruly behaviour, lack of respect etc have existed in every one of the schools. The difference is that at the Independent School in particular you pay for a service and the administration is very accountable. I can't help but notice that the Inner West Selective High School that I live near has more luxury cars dropping off their children that the Independent School my child attends. Perhaps its about time that some parents start contributing more in financial terms if they are truly committed to Public education. &#10;Has anyone else noticed the decline in Australia's international education ranking and the rise in private school attendance? I suspect the reasons are twofold, public schools have been diminished by various governments and private schools are not really doing as well as touted. &#10;I have no issues with private schools, my children go public to learn strong secular values and good inclusive ethical values and not those of any one religious sect, it is my choice. &#10;That Tony and Christopher hate secularism and will seek to destroy public education is my fear. I suspect giving greater autonomy to local communities will empower the dominant community at the expense of others (unless you join of course), not my idea of a secular institution..
