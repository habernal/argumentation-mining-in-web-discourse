Which may be for a variety of reasons, not because we think the parents are &quot;selfish.&quot;&quot; &#10;Actually, you couldn't possibly understand my frustrations unless you, like me, had home educated your children for the past 17 years, and seen, and heard, and lived through, the prejudice against this life choice as I have. Unless you, like me, had participated in political struggles in three different geographic juristictions to maintain freedoms for law-abiding citizens who had done nothing wrong or unethical, much less illegal. Citizens that other people occasionally decide should be &quot;monitored&quot; because of the educational choices they make for their children, based on no actual evidence whatsoever. Sorry, but my reaction may indicate some emotion, which I freely admit, but it is not over the top. When a minority group is experiencing persecution, one of the regular tacticis pulled out of the hat is the accusation that they are &quot;overreacting.&quot; Reaction is not &quot;over&quot; reaction. Fighting for freedoms requires that people be galvanized, and often demands emotional response. People are sometimes uncomfortable with this. &#10;Another comment was made, I believe, about me thinking that no one but parents are entitled to make decisions for children. &#10;Well, yes. Absolutely. Why would anyone else have any reason to be involved in the lives of or make decisions on behalf of children, other than their parents and themselves? Why should any other person have a claim on, or interest in, their life choices? This kind of interference can only be justified in cases of abuse and child protection. Sadly, these things do occur. Sometimes children have to be protected. But there must be evidence to justify this interference, and if no such evidence is present, then parents, and children, must be allowed to conduct their lives in peace, without government interference. That, actually, is what living in a free society is all about. I continue to prefer to live in a free society. &#10;There are no one-size-fits-all answers about how children should be raised and educated. Throughout human history we have experienced an enormous continuum on this point. Humans are immensely diverse in their preferences, abilities, predilictions, and needs. Societies are diverse in their demands upon individuals. In our society, a parent who chooses a school-based education for their child is rarely questioned about that choice, regardless of whether the school is a state institution, religiously based, experimental, Steiner, public, private, what have you. Why people decide that parents who choose, or allow their children to choose, NO school, in good conscience, and with an immense body of evidence behind them to support their decision, must justify their decisions and actions to others, remains a complete mystery to me. And yes, it is evidence of prejudice, which sometimes becomes persecution. &#10;If the commenter above would actually consider what she said, she might realize this. Replace the word &quot;homeschool&quot; with &quot;school&quot; in her sentence and see what happens: &quot;Like I say, I understand her frustrations and I´m sure she has encountered a lot of negativity (there has been some on this thread) that is completely inappropriate, but this reaction also seems a little over the top and emotional also and doesn´t do anything to convince people who are against school.&quot; &#10;See what I mean? What if the situation were reversed, and it was the parents who chose school who were in the minority? What if they were punished, monitored, and threatened with intervention in their family lives because they chose to send their children to school, because they honestly believed school would best meet their children's needs? What if they were discriminated against because they really didn't feel they could take on their children's education themselves? Seem a little &quot;over the top&quot;? A little unfair? &#10;Why should I have to convince you? Why should you have an opinion on how I educate my kids? It is not your business. Are you Protestant, Muslim, Jewish, atheist? Do you then feel that you can have an opinion about parents who send their children to Catholic schools? Or vice versa? No? Then leave the home educators alone.
