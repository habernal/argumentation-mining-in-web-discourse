Since our state has a Septmember 1 cutoff, she was one of the oldest in her class instead of one of the youngest. She is very academically advanced, but she was never bored in Kindergarten. Her teacher just gave her differentiated work. The fact that she was a little more mature probably helped, becuase she was able to work more on her own and when she was given a book and told to write a paragraph about a different ending, she could spend an hour doing it. &#10;Now, my 8 yo has a March birthday so he's right in the middle. But, when it came time to K for him, we knew he wasn't ready. I mean, academically he was well prepared, but he just couldn't sit still and be well behaved in a class of 25 kids. We ended up sending him to a private K, which turned out to be a class of 11 other boys whose parents thought they &quot;weren't quite ready&quot; either. &#10;He did get in some trouble that year. And the next year when he moved to public school. As a second grader, he finally has the skills needed to sit still and follow rules in school. And he's doing 6th grade math, so it isn't like he's behind. He's just a very busy boy.
