They still have to pay not only for  their children's private school education but also pay taxes on their property that goes to the public schools.  This is a choice that parents have in this country. How dare an  one say that it is wrong to send your children to a private school.  How dare anyone say that these parents are not concerned about our public school system just because they choose to send their children to a private school.  This is America where we still have freedom of choice.  What's next? Someone telling the parents that they can't voice their opinion because they send their children to a private school.  My Dad served on non a local school board for over 30 years.  We were all educated in a private school.  His reasoning for wanting to serve was not political or monetary. He wanted the best education for all children whose parents sent their children to a public school because they couldn't afford the private school.  What's next on the table?  Are the parent's of children who go to a private school going to be told that they can't vote on school millage because their children don't participate in the public education but they still must pay the taxes?  WOULD THESE PARENT'S WHO SAY THAT OUR CHILDREN MUST ATTEND A PUBLIC SCHOOL WANT SOMEONE TELLING THEM THEY CAN'T BUY A CERTAIN MAKE OF CAR OF THEIR CHOICE BECAUSE IT'S UN-AMERICAN?  DO YOU WANT SOMEONE TELLING YOU HOW TO DRESS?  Do they want to go back to the system that our ancestors fought so hard to achieve when they came to this country because that's what was happening in countries like Poland, Russia and Germany.  WAKE UP AMERICA BECAUSE WHETHER YOU REALIZE IT OR NOT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE IN AMERICA. TOTAL GOVERNMENT CONTROL OVER YOUR LIFE.  IF YOU DON'T WAKE UP FROM THE NIGHTMARE THAT IS TAKING PLACE HERE IN AMERICA, WE ALL WILL SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES OF TOTAL GOVERNMENT CONTROL.  IS THIS WHAT YOU REALLY WANT?  I DON'T AND WILL FIGHT TO THE BITTER END TO SEE THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN.  MY ANCESTORS FOUGHT TO HARD TO GIVE ME AND ALL AMERICANS THE FREEDOM THAT WE HAVE. WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT WHAT THEY LEFT BEHIND???????    I DON'T AND I TRULY FEEL THAT NO TRUE AMERICAN WANTS IT EITHER.  STOP AND TELL YOUR SENATORS, REPRESENTATIVES AND THOSE IN POWER THAT ENOUGH IS ENOUGH AND YOU WON'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.  I will end these comments with a simple example.  IF OBAMACARE AND COMMON CORE IS SO GREAT, WHY DON'T OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE IT FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND IF COMMON CORE IS SO GREAT, WHY ARE THEY STILL SENDING THEIR CHILDREN  TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS?  WHAT'S GOOD FOR US SHOULD BE GOOD FOR ALL!!!!
