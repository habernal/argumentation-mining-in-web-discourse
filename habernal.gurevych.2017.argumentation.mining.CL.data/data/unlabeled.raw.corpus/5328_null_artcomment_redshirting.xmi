I'm one of those individuals in society who has never &quot;fit in,&quot; being overly sensitive and shy by nature, so the social aspects of any get-together were never pleasant even before I started school. They still aren't. I learned to read at home out of my own ambition and desire to understand the written word, which ticked off my teachers because they didn't have to teach me how, and they couldn't deal with a pupil who was &quot;ahead&quot; in one aspect while average or below average with others. &#10;I was more than grateful for starting early when, in middle school, I found myself being bullied by those my own age–luckily, I was one grade above them and thus able to escape these evil individuals for a year; my grade point average jumped from a 1.7 in the junior high spring semester to a 3.2 in my first high school fall semester, if that gives you any idea of the anxiety and classroom difficulties they were causing me. Graduating at 17 years of age was another plus, because my final year consisted of classes that have served me no purpose whatsoever and were taken just to match the school credit count (in fact, I had three study halls and an early dismissal from last period for my final year–what a waste of time!). &#10;I agree with another poster on here. I think the American education system keeps kids in its grade schools for too long (18-19), and most offer next to nothing when it comes to vocational, hands-on training which should start around the age of 14-15. We basically turn our &quot;kids&quot; loose in the world when they hit adulthood but with none of the workplace skills they'll need.
