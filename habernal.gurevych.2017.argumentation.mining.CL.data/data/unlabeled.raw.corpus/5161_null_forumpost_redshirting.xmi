I could argue that the age could get younger and younger and soon we will have to send our 2 and 3 year olds to kindergarten. My DS will be 5 when he starts Kindergarten. He will turn 6 less than a month after he starts. I just could not wrap my head around sending my DS to kindergarten at the age of 4. It seems entirely too young to me. Even a mature 4 year old could use an extra year to be a young kid with no worries. &#10;I loved school, all 13 years of mandatory school were a blast for me. As were the years I was in college. I have no problem with my children going to school and it is a phase of life I hope they enjoy as much as I did, but at 4 years old it is nice for my kids to be able to do things on our family's schedule and not have to worry about having to go to school every week day. &#10;If the child is going to be in daycare all day anyway, might as well start them in school at age 4, but I work a schedule that makes it possible for my children to not go to daycare. My DS goes to pre-school a few times a week for a few hours, but he can miss it if we want him to and I still get to spend time with him. This fall will start a new and exciting chapter of his life and I am very excited for it, but I did not want to rush it at all. &#10;I am not in any hurry to be away from my children for 8 or 9 hours a day, 5 days a week. Why begrudge me that.
