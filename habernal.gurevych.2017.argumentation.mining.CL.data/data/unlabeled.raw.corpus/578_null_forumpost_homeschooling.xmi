The lack of that access for children who actually attend public schools is what I object to. &#10;How do the PS kids not have access to those things? I'm still waiting for you to give specifics. &#10;I guess it's hard for me sometimes to imagine there's all there's God awful public schools out there that so many homeschoolers can't imagine their children attending. &#10;For me, it has nothing to do with the quality of public schools, and everything to do with my philosophy on education and learning. &#10;&quot; In 2007, the most common reason parents gave as the most important was a desire to provide religious or moral instruction (36 percent of students)&quot; &#10;Last time I checked, 36% was not &quot;most&quot;. This is also not even remotely the same as purposely avoiding diversity. &#10;It also cites a few other reasons that may be code for a desire to avoid mixing with the general population or evading mainstream education. &#10;&quot;May be&quot; =/= &quot;is&quot;, not to mention that you're interpreting it that way, and are not exactly subtle about your massive bias. &#10;So, yes, the negative opinion of public schools most definitely affects me and my job, and I'm currently just barely making it on my salary as it is. &#10;The negative opinion of public schools is coming from people who send their kids to public schools. Homeschoolers are a tiny tiny fraction of all families who have school aged children. &#10;Maybe we teachers are jaded, but it sure would be helpful to have the support of our communitites as we fight to give the best education to the kids we have in our classrooms while those with power over our ability to do so try to tear us down. &#10;You're even admitting that it's the administrators and the legislators that are the issue. Come on. The lack of community support is from people who are pissed because their kids are getting a subpar PS education. &#10;I understand that no one here has actively spoken out against teachers, but there are most definitely consequences to the people of the community losing faith in the public school system, and most of those consquences fall on the teachers. &#10;And again, that is not the fault of homeschoolers."/><type4:DocumentMetaData xmi:id="13" sofa="1" begin="0" end="2135" language="en" documentId="578" isLastSegment="false"/><types:WebArgumentMetadata xmi:id="24" sofa="1" begin="0" end="0" author="ninjaeema" date="09/05/2013" docType="forumpost" origUrl="http://community.babycenter.com/post/a44369503/home_schooling_debate_this_hypothetical?cpg=23" topic="homeschooling" thumbsUp="0" thumbsDown="0" origId="578" notes="" title="Home schooling: Debate this hypothetical"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="39" sofa="1" begin="0" end="111"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="43" sofa="1" begin="112" end="209"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="47" sofa="1" begin="210" end="378"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="51" sofa="1" begin="379" end="511"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="55" sofa="1" begin="512" end="662"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="59" sofa="1" begin="663" end="777"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="63" sofa="1" begin="778" end="919"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="67" sofa="1" begin="920" end="1044"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="71" sofa="1" begin="1045" end="1195"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="75" sofa="1" begin="1196" end="1382"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="79" sofa="1" begin="1383" end="1628"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="83" sofa="1" begin="1629" end="1843"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="87" sofa="1" begin="1844" end="2084"/><type6:Paragraph xmi:id="91" sofa="1" begin="2085" end="2135"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="13 24 39 43 47 51 55 59 63 67 71 75 79 83 87 91"/></xmi:XMI>
