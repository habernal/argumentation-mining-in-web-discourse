What skills precisely are the children who spend much of their days playing video games becoming acquainted with? The father seems to acknowledge that they sired too many kids for home schooling to be practicable even if his wife has the capacity to instruct their kids in curricula as diverse as trigonometry, chemistry, civics (I know... few schools actually teach an actual civics course anymore) and English composition, which is doubtful. Are we to understand that he is OK with the first eight kids being denied the full education they deserve and require because, after all, the final four will be given more comprehensive instruction once the numbersbecome more manageable? What kind of disservice are they doing to these kids if they know God well but hardly anything else?? It's almost unfortunate for the younger siblings that, through persistence and hard work the oldest sibling is actually thriving despite having been denied the education that his peers receive in public and private schools, or even in homes where the parents are compelled to demonstrate that the child is receiving some minimal amount of instruction. After all, it sounds as though they are not all similarly motivated to learn and the parents are apparently not forcing them to do anything they don't want to. &#10;It's clear the school district is denying these kids entry for fear of a lawsuit, which is unfortunate but understandable in this litigious society in which we live. Maybe, hopefully, the ACLU will step in on their behalf.
