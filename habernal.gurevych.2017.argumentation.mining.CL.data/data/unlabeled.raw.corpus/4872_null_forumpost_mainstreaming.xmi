Alfie started at nursery in a special needs school in january and it's the best thing we ever did. he has come on so much in just the few months he has attended and will go for 5 mornings in september. we had no problems with him being statemented without a diagnosis. Our decision was easy, i knew he would benefit much more from being in a setting that was geared up for his needs however every child is different and i think what you need to think about is how much will your child get from being in a mainstream school and can they cope with your childs demands. ive worked in education in my old job and if you get the right mainstream school they can be fantastic as long as you get the support you need and while it's important to listen to the professionals involved with your child ultimately you know your child best and do remember nothing is set in stone if you try a mainstream school and it isn't working you can always change, the school will be keep regular meetings with you and they will say if they don't think it's working x x were all angels in waiting!!
